Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Peter G.,"I am hesitant to write this review for two reasons. First of all, Bottega Louie is one of my all time favorite restaurants in LA and second, I'm going to admit that for the first time in my life I gave a bad tip. I wish it all went to the barback.I got in at 1030pm solo and knowing the palace closes at 11pm I planned to sit at the bar. 7 of the stools at the bar were taken up by a 3 person party with bags on the stools beside them, and one stool in between each of them as well. several bar tables behind them were seated, I imagine they may have wanted bar seating but, who can guess? I took the remaining far corner seat next to the wall, not an issue for me, I thought.I sat for several minutes but worried the kitchen may be closing I finally called out to the barback and he came over and I asked if I could still have dinner, which he said yes. After the barback pointed me out and several long minutes the bartender finally realized I was there and gave me a menu. I wished they just told me no.I ordered over $100 worth of items. After I gave the order I wanted a soda too but had to wave my arm in the air after waiting 5 minutes to get the bartender's attention. When my food came after 5 minutes of staring at him, I had to wave my arm in the air to get the bartender's attention for chilli and parm. After my drink was visibly empty for awhile, I had to wave my arm in the air for the bartender to fill it. I wondered if he could at least just check on me once without me having to call out or raise my hand. He finally at the end, came without me calling him.....  to give me the check.TIPS acronym: ""To Insure Prompt Service"".","Los Angeles, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/T_LEYuzhdWhKyALPq9fnEw/60s.jpg,4/12/2023,599,29,6

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Andrew P.,"Looking for top rated pizza in DTLA and this place was rated number one.  I ordered a $30 margarita pizza and asked to have it tin and crispy.  Server told me it was always thin and crispy.  It arrived thick, doughy and undercooked.  I asked if I can have it cooked more and was told they would make me a new one.  When the second one came, it was only slightly better.  I wanted to send this one back as well, but decided to just deal with the loss.  A $30 pizza shouldn't look like an out of the oven Digiorno frozen pizza, and that is what it literally looked like.  They need to teach the pizza maker how to use a brick oven.   Who ever rated this number one should share whatever they are smoking.","San Francisco, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,9/18/2022,0,2,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,1 2.,Your website states that you don't need reservations because your restaurant has 255 tables. So our party of 8 showed up on a Thursday night and we were told that there would be a 2 1/2 hour wait! That is simply absurd! You don't take reservations but expect people to wait two and a half hours for a table? You should make exceptions and take reservations for big parties. So don't waste your time here. We went around the corner to H&H Brazillian Steakhouse and were happy to give them our money for an amazing dinner experience and extremely friendly service! I gave Louie Bottega one star for their pastries which we did purchase to go after we ate dinner at H&H Brazillian Steakhouse.,"Goodyear, AZ",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,1/8/2020,0,2,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Grover M.,The noise in this restaurant during prime eating times is beyond endurance.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,D B.,"I had a terrible experience at the restaurant. They should be ashamed of the quality of the service and the food. I asked for a steak without sauce or butter as I have a dairy allergy. The food came, and alas, it was covered with butter. They made a new one, but by the time it came, my friends were pretty much done eating. AND, the steak was terrible. Overcooked, almost burnt to a crisp. It's far too expensive, and nights out with good friends are far to rare, for this sort of thing to happen. Shame on you Bottega Louie.

You will feel as if you are inside the latest nightclub since everybody is yelling, except the music is not loud enough and you will hear everybody else's convos. on top of that the greedy owners have put the tiny tables right next to each other and the concept of personal space is unknown to them. - James","Los Angeles, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,2/18/2017,0,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Freddy C.,"REVIEW ABOUT DR. MATIAN  FARIBORZ  DDS-   DENTIST  02/23/2015                             Morella Esparragoza and I, Freddy Castillo, went to Dr. Matian Fariborz DDS Inc located at 19900 Ventura  Blvd #200, Woodland Hills,California 91364 for dental services in December 2010. I am dissatisfied the way his business handled the billing to my two dental insurance providers They filed the claims with errors, omissions some 10 months later and some over a year later. He failed to submit claims on time for the 2010  allowance and nothing was billed to the insurance provider and same occurred with the claims the following year. The claim were denied by the insurance companies due incomplete report, late filing. I have found similar complaints against Dr. Matian, with the Better Business Bureau  for the same reasons. He performed procedures not previously approved by me or my wife neither by the insurance companies and he went after his clients for payment over those procedures, demanding full payment ,  rather than the prices under contract with the insurance providers. This practice is unethical and misleading to his patients. On every occasion he misled  us into believing that the  large majority of the expenses were to be covered by the insurance providers.  Four years later he is requesting payment for his services for an amount almost double of the original estimate given to us. We are in court proceeding  and appeals to resolve the disputed amount,  I offered to settle for a more reasonable charge but he refused to accept the offer. No bills, invoices, or phone calls were ever made to me despite of my request to solve this issue. I was sent to collection  to harass me and my wife while  we were in court. The paper work at his office is in complete disarray as far as documenting the claims,  making you responsible for payments after the claims are denied. His behavior is reprehensible and despicable. I will never use his services again or recommend this Dentist to anybody.","Los Angeles, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/-BWrV1n88HOeZGfW48hxhg/60s.jpg,2/23/2015,0,2,

I tried to sue both of them or at least get some of my money back, it is very hard to sue a dentist, I did report them to the dental board and the bbb. I did have to replace all the work in my mouth, I had $12,000.00  at Dr Noor and $9,000.00 at Dr. Daniel  Binafard, I am only glad I did not have dental insurance till after I left, I had all my dental work redone for about $17,000.00 in Korea town, best dentist in the world in Korea town.","Los Angeles, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,12/2/2013,0,2,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Connie M.,"I recently took three colleagues to Bottega Louie for lunch. We waited an hour to be seated, after being told the wait was 15 minutes. The Host kept seating people who came AFTER my party. I approached the Maitre'd who simply ignored me. When I complained to the manager, he told me loudly that they could not ""babysit everyone waiting for a table"", in a rude, insolent tone and manner. He then told us that it was ""irrelevant"" that groups who came in after us were seated before we were. Obviously, I disagree, and I suppose money was changing hands. The management at this restaurant are the most obnoxious and self-important two men I have ever encountered ANYWHERE. This is my first Yelp review, and I hope never to have the occasion to write such a review again. However, I feel compelled to share this disgusting experience.","Los Angeles, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/RTlAz8q1Evl3__y2B9KjFw/60s.jpg,3/11/2011,11,1,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Lauren L.,"I have been a long-time customer of Louie and I love their food. Recently however, the service has been so bad I almost walked out before the food even got to the table. This past Saturday was the second time that we have complained to the manager. The waitress was rude and inattentive. Her answers were short and disdainful. I asked what kind of coffee they had (because I wasn't sure if  they had rotated espresso brands) and she looked at me exasperatedly and said, ""Cappuccino, espresso, lattes."" Don't worry, I SAW the gigantic espresso machine when I walked through the door. I kind of figured there would be espresso drinks on the menu. Thanks for clarifying the obvious. Then when I asked how much a double shot would cost in comparison, she ignored my question and left. The server brought something to our table that we had asked for early to eat with an appetizer, and then took it off of our table to give to another customer when they asked for it. It doesn't matter what kind of restaurant it is, that is unprofessional. As a manager of a restaurant in Aspen, CO, I was appalled by this action. Once you have brought something to a customer's table, you leave it there and go get another one for the next customer. I'm sure there wasn't a shortage of condiments. Even if there is, you leave it with the customer you initially gave it to unless you ask and explain the situation. Then when we asked the server to please give us what he had taken away from our table, because we were using it, he said ""yeah, I'll bring it before your food comes."" The food it accompanied was already there.When we called the manager over to tell him about our waitress's attitude and the actions of the server, he said ""Look, what do you want me to do about it?"" A manager should NEVER act like this is a personal affront. He should NEVER get defensive, and I was stunned that he behaved so immaturely. We were not rude when we spoke to him, nor were we, at this point, upset. I was stunned at his behavior. He was young, but he should have had some sort of managerial skills. We were simply letting him know that this was ruining a special evening. At a place like that, you expect good service. After this, he ignored us. So too did the waitress. She then forgot my coffee, which took two conversations to order. She took away my date's drink when it was half full, without a replacement and returned it ten minutes later after we asked where it had gone.Because our waitress was blatantly ignoring us, we had to call over the manager again as he was the only one around, to ask if I was ever going to get my coffee. I had been waiting over 25 minutes and had almost finished eating. At this point, another table asked him if they were ever going to get their order and asked for the check instead because of the waitress' attitude. Apparently she hadn't brought a birthday dessert the girls had ordered as a surprise for their friend and had just been sitting there with empty glasses and un-cleared plates for a while. Their friend had found out about it because of the long wait time and they just decided to leave to go somewhere else for dessert, as their surprise had been ruined.I think the manager finally got the idea that his servers were terrible and he finally apologized, albeit, he shouldn't have had to had he trained his employees well.I have recommended Louie to friends and family for months now, yet the fact that this is the second time I have had a horrible experience at Louie, (the first being two months ago when the waitress ignored all of her tables and everyone in her section was trying to get anyone's attention) I will not be a patron of theirs again. I hadn't been back in two months because of the horrible service last time. I absolutely love their food, and I don't mind the wait, but I do not appreciate the rude abuse dished out by their staff. If I want to go on a date, or even on a business lunch, I will be taking my business and friends elsewhere.Also, the cupcakes were dry and the icing had too much butter in it. It tasted oily.","Aspen, CO",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jF5oMXOSmhOY5HGnR1l6LQ/60s.jpg,2/25/2011,0,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Sally H.,"VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I went there with coworkers for lunch on Dec. 16, 2010. We were a group of 12 and the restaurant didn't take reservations. They prepared a table for us and it was very surprising. They set up a 5-foot round table and tried to fit all of us in one table! We were all thinking - REALLY? They didn't offer to break us into two tables until several of us had asked why we were crammed in one table. They didn't really seem to want to listen to our complaint. We literally didn't have any elbow room even before the plates were served. HMMM...I DON'T WANT TO PULL THE ""RACE"" CARD BUT I'M WONDERING IF IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH US BEING ALL ASIAN.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Gillian S.,"I've never met a boutique I didn't like.  The tiny little boxes pristinely packaged with fantastic bows cinched over the tops and sides, the sparkling artifacts exemplified on pedestals in the storefront windows, realizing that the number of items for sale is directly proportional to the number of years it will take to pay for one item at full price, having to ask to see everything...four times: just lovely.  When asked to go eat at Bottega Louie in Downtown LA the other night, I was excited.  I was more than willing to go super-extra early when the senior citizens eat because the place DOESN'T ACCEPT RESERVATIONS, no problem.  Knowing that the place gets very crowded at the stroke of 8:30 pm, it must be delightful.  Bottega, in Italian, means small store or boutique.  What's the worse that could happen?LESSON LEARNED: Don't judge a bottega by it's storefront glass. (if you wanna be a stickler, don't judge a book by it's cover.) Red Flag #1:  I walked inside and was pleasantly greeted by a glass case of sugary delights.  Glistening cupcakes, éclairs, and cookies were staring back at me... but as I turned the corner, the fluorescent light seemed to grow more harsh and the once-full glass case of goodness was beginning to look empty.  Had Bottega Louie already thrown in the towel?  Thought to itself ""I already reeled her in, no more effort necessary?"" I was startled by the lack of sweetness and the over abundance of neon white glow.Red Flag #2:As any good media whore would do, I checked into my social outlets to let my fans know of my whereabouts (aka, feed my addictions).  I checked into yelp, Facebook, and foursquare.  Right away, I got the JUST DESSERT badge.  This was a sign. Red Flag #3:Yes, 'regentrification' seems to be what LA is all about these days.  I get it.  Well done for it has worked on me.  You have successfully lured me into a brand new, yet still old, but strangely new (let's settle on retro), building that was supposed to be torn down but that is now a hip, cool, ultra louge-hangout-hotspot-eatery-wateringhole-cupcakery-datingspot-ithink.  While I used to be really scared about driving to the projects where missions serve homeless people who have lost cognitive function years ago and now babble at parking meters, I know park at those same meters and walk by myself to Bottega Louie.  However, you forgot to think of the function of the space.  It is a concrete and marble high-ceiling LARGE partitioned space.  Since no one stopped to think about acoustical engineering, (or even art on the walls let alone anything to break the monotony from the ceiling) it is a wretched spot for a restaurant.  I couldn't hear a thing.  It is probably best served as a space for a screaming contest.Red Flag #4:One of the great things about LA is that waiters and waitresses (I don't know, is that even PC anymore?) are beautiful.  The commercially artistic yet unemployed (ie. Actors, singers, artists, dancers, musicians, and other pretty faces) go to high-end restaurants and submit their headshots (yes, headshots) for jobs.  The idea of it is deplorable, but while sitting at a table, I don't really mind.  At Bottega Louie, it's fairly obvious that the wait staff was more carefully selected than that of the cast of Gossip Girl.  However, I'm not quite sure our waiter was actually literate.  Even worse, I'm not sure what's more annoying that not finding your waiter than having an overly attentive one.  He stood 2 FEET FROM THE TABLE.  EVERYTIME I LOOKED UP at anything ANYTHING (!), HE CAME OVER.    Red Flag #5:Refer to #2.  When we received our food, some of it was inedible.  DO NOT ORDER THE HEIRLOOM CARROTS.  Peter Rabbit, after a cleanse, wouldn't eat those.  People at the next table over were pointing and making gag faces.  Seriously, if I was at the next table over, I would ask the waiter to take these carrots away.  They were THAT BAD.  Also, I was taking home an entrée for my boyfriend.  Now, it's really difficult to mess up Chicken Parm, but somehow Bottega Louie managed to figure out a way.  Yes, Louie, the breading calls for an egg.  NO, YOU DO NOT THROW THE ENTIRE EGG INTO A FOOD PROCESSOR, SHELL AND ALL.  I'm not making this up. THERE WERE SO MANY EGG SHELLS IN HIS CHICKEN PARM, I wonder if a monkey had broken into the kitchen, tied everyone up, and started messing with the orders.  We ordered dessert and it was actually really good.  The Foursquare badge was right.  None of this fiasco would have happened if we had JUST ORDERED DESSERT.  Again, Lesson learned:  Don't judge a bottega by it's storefront glass case....","Los Angeles, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/_Qgd7Z6HhQV0yiR8_KiTQQ/60s.jpg,11/22/2010,184,39,

Very beautiful restaurant, the desserts look very good and the atmosphere felt fun, the problem.....bad service. We had to ask for the menus and the had 4 different servers bring our food, they were not attentive at all! We saw as the employees shoot the s#*t with each other and ""managers"" walked around sipping coffee but did not pay attention to what matters....the COSTUMER :) A brief count showed 30 employees on duty including 5 ""managers"". One drinking coffee one sitting at a table chatting. Not once were we asked if we need refills or if the food was good. Nothing not once. The servers one brought water, one brought drinks, one brought salad and one brought pizza all different and not one was attentive (except for the first who was actually a bartender not a waiter or server) The pizza was not fully cooked, we waited to get our check and waited and waited but finally we got up and asked for our tab.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Lana N.,"Normally, I would never post a negative blog about waiting in a popular restaurant; however, I found it very offensive about the treatment I received on my visit.  Let it be said that service is NOT exceptional in this restaurant.  When I arrived on a weekday, I was told that the wait is 15min, which turned out to be an hour.  I had a party of 3 and I was seated at the end of the booth with my other 2 guests next to the pizza oven, which is obviously too small and uncomfortable.  Additionally, the extremely rude hostess told me that we will be seated at the next available table; however, preference was given to parties of 2 and 4s.  This was so obvious when dinning guests, who arrived well past my arrival time, had to wait less than 15min to be seated...what a way to ruin a great evening!","San Gabriel, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,1/27/2010,0,1,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Tom L.,"Lousy service, lousy food.  And now the particulars...  Went on a Saturday morning with an out-of-town guest.  The pix don't do justice to Bottega Louie: twenty-foot cielings, white tablecloths, white marble... very unexpected in Los Angeles (and I've lived here all my life).  However...  Though staff was numerous, it took 15 minutes just to order coffee and juice.  The juice didn't arrive for nearly half an hour (the wait-person had to be reminded, and didn't apologize for the delay).  The food took 45 minutes.  My wife and I ordered frittatas (she, the capresi; I, the roasted vegetable).  The frittatas were the worst I've eaten.  If there were vegetables anywhere in the egg, they were very elusive.  The thing was smothered in melted cheese - so much that it was oily.  Happy to get out of there.  Despite all, I may go back - the place was full by the time we left, and maybe we just caught a bad table on a bad day.  Even so: among the worst dining experiences I've had.","Los Angeles, CA",1.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,10/24/2009,0,2,

They added a fruit jelly mixed in with the créame, and the créame was more dense than fluffy. I only come to this place because the créame was so unique and delicious compared to all other places I had been. The fruit tart tasted like something I have had somewhere else for a better price.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Sharon C.,"The food was ok, and the service during our meal was fine. They came to check up on us, and even helped surprise my friend for her birthday!However, the issue came after we paid. The bill had included an additonal surcharge, which after a quick glance, we assumed to mean that tip was included. The waitstaff, Geofferey, chased us down and interrupted us mid-conversation, and badger us about if his service was subpar. After explaining we thought the surcharge was a tip, he rudely said, ""No."", shook his head, and continued asking about why his service didn't warrant a tip.1. We understand why he is upset. However, since when were waiters and waitresses to rudely interrupt conversations and openly make a scene about a tip?2. Upon looking more closely at the bill, we see that it's only 4%, and it is to help mitigate the employees' wages and benefits. While I'm all for supporting higher wages, we came to pay for food and service,  not wages that an employer is too cheap to pay. You own a bougie restaurant. Please pay your employees fairly and with benefits!3. We would have appreciated a brief explanation of what the surcharge, as it would be polite to do so instead of being so defensive. We would happily tip, he gave great service during our meal, it was simply a misunderstanding. However, the reaction and response to the circumstances made us second guess our judgement of your service.Conclusion: Please teach your waitstaff to respond to stressful situations politely. And please pay them their fair wages without taking from your guests.Update----Thank you; we spoke with management about this issue, and they were very kind to us and took care of the matter.","La Puente, CA",2.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/4QG1imvLUuVLJSLBWRniGg/60s.jpg,7/8/2019,449,8,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Paula B.,"I don't understand why this place has so many good reviews. The service is slow, and very snobbish. I came here a while ago and had a bad experience. My friend has been begging me to go with her, and I reluctantly accepted, hoping it would change my mind about it. Sadly, my opinion of this establishment remains the same. The place gets two stars because the food and desserts are good. However, for the prices you would expect better servings on the entrees. I was left so hungry after ordering two appetizers and two entrees (between my friend and I). The burrata pizza was actually pretty good. I got the hanger steak verdura, and the steak was not cooked properly. The glaze was good, but a little too over powering though. The tomato bruschetta was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I will say, the Lobster Nage was good and my friend and I finished it pretty quickly.Once we were finished with our meal ordered the tiramisu, which is my favorite dessert, and this one was pretty good. Service: Was awful, we had to flag down our waiter multiple times. When we couldn't get him, another waitress told us she would find him and pass along our request to him. However the couple of times this happened, nothing came of it. It was frustrating having to keep looking for our waiter instead of being focused on our meal.Setting: It is so loud inside!!! Throughout the dinner I had a hard time hearing my friend. Upon looking around I realized it is due to the high ceilings. The acoustics inside are horrible, magnifying the sound of everyone inside so much more. And so every one is left basically shouting over one another trying to hear their friends. They really should figure something out with that because it really was an issue.","Los Angeles, CA",2.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,2/23/2016,10,11,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Kenzo M.,"I've tried this place more than I probably should have thinking somewhere on the menu is a jewel that can match the amazing desserts, sadly that was not to be. No, the decor is great,  the open kitchen a nice talking piece when with company, but it's not the food or the service in the restaurant portion of Bottega Louie that makes this place great. The Pastry Counter on the other hand.....wow, Every single thing in that little counter is amazing and believe me I've tried every singe one of them. The service is also much better at the pastry counter and much more friendly and professional. Try the passion fruit tart or any of the macaroons and you'll agree these are little bites of heaven. Over all not a win but the desserts make you forget that it's too loud takes too long to be served and the food is over priced for the quality and service provided. Still, none of that matters because even though it has it's bad qualities, like that bad relationship or lame birthday party, I still keep coming back for the dessert.","Los Angeles, CA",2.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/RwHim689x2U-oaA4uEOwTw/60s.jpg,2/16/2016,4,12,

I mean all you need to do is drop extra petals on it FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!"" And then the lady goes on by saying, apparently I have to go into the bakery one day ahead and request that, and then the next day go and pick up the cake.

The looks for the deserts and pastries is a 5. The food is a 2 or 3. The concept is awesome. You feel like you are in a New York cafeteria or commissary of some sort. The acoustics are deafening and so it's not a super place if you need to discuss important details during a business meeting. I occasionally stop in for their awesome club sandwich or a salad. Again, it's good... Not great. I def give them major props for having over 10K reviews and being able to maintain their 4 star rating.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Catherine S.,"1-1/2 weeks ago we went to Chi Chi's for dinner with friends.  We ordered the Antipasto Salad which is always wonderful.  In addition, we ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and I asked if it was possible to put broccoli in it, she said sure (but didn't way it would cost extra and how much extra).  I was very surprised as when we got the bill, they charged us $4.00 for the additional broccoli. That was too much of an additional charge!We then visited again last night and ordered the Chicken Parmesan which came with a very small side of spaghetti.  I don't know what they did or how they prepared the breaded chicken in the 'Chicken Parmesan', but it felt and tasted like it had been prebreaded and frozen for a quick fix.  It was terrible.  Dry and tasteless..I really likde Chi Chi's when we first began going there, but not now.  It seems their prices have grown and the quality is quickly fading!  Too bad!","Venice, CA",2.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,12/14/2014,0,7,

Although I may be a bit partial, the New York Egg Sandwich was really nothing special; it was good, but not great.  It was certainly not worth $10.  Not really sure what qualifies this as a ""New York"" egg sandwich...perhaps just the Kaiser roll?  I used to grab comparable sandwiches on the way to work from the neighborhood bodegas, carts, etc. at a fraction of the price.  I realize I'm paying for the ambiance and service, but come on...$10 for a simple egg sandwich?  I'll probably come back to give it another shot -- and try another dish -- but until then, going to stick with 2 stars.","New York, NY",2.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/itYkOqUwZ2iqKm3sv-F1vQ/60s.jpg,11/5/2014,17,64,26

Especially when it felt like walking into a very busy michelin starred cafe in central Paris. I was right about the price but with great disappointment the food was nothing short of mediocrity. The smoked salmon eggs Benedict was nothing special, i've had better for half the price. The coffee au lait was awful; it was probably the worst coffee i've drank in LA. Pros: great environment and lots of pastries to choose from. Cons: portions were small and not worth the premium. Verdict: Overpriced and overrated.

Then they changed chefs and things went a bit downhill.  I get the pasta and brussel sprouts mostly but have had a lot of other things on the menu. It's disappointing when the simple things cannot be done. What's up with the chopped up brussel sprouts or may be they were chewed up. Whatever, the dish was ruined for me after that. I sent it back the first couple of times it happened. Then was told that's how they've always made them. No, I've been going since they first opened. I asked right after getting my food if they had a new chef that's how often I went. They said yes about a week or two ago, how can you tell. I said my food isn't as good.  I guess chopping it makes it look like more but with less sprouts but yet at the same price. The table next to me was disappointed too they heard me complain and had their say. The desserts are still fab though.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Mylaunna L.,"Over-priced and over-rated (at least where the restaurant portion is concerned).  I went there for the first time today and experienced more lows than highs.  Not only would I not recommend a visit or revisit, I wouldn't introduce it to anyone either.  Sounds a bit harsh, but why spend your money on something mediocre when a mom and pop up the way would leave you more satisfied.  Mind you I did give the restaurant 2 stars, not for the overall experience but solely for the incredible fried potrabellas.  The portabellas were the highlight.  So if you are with a group just order several rounds of the portabellas.  The salads are very fresh and light and the pizza was pretty good. But the pasta was truly so disappointing that I recommend avoiding that entire column of choices.  Then If you desire any wine, champagne or cocktails, please order them while you are waiting to be seated them you may receive them before you finish your meal.  As my plate was being taken before I finished my pizza, I was trying to order a 1/2 of spumante as a close to my meal.  Not only had everyone at our table finished their meal, along with more conversation, we received our bill 15 minutes later and still no glass of champagne.  So I told our server to cancel it as she casually laid the bill on our table.  Her response was, 'Then I'll have to remove it from the tab.'  My response was, ""Yes (nod), you do that!""  Then she had the nerve to pass by later and say, ""No worries about the champange.""  To which I replied, ""No kidding.""  As she was walking away she says, "" I just had the bartender to pour it back in the bottle.""  I gave no response to that.  I jus t thought to myself.  Some nerve.  Who waits 15 minutes for a half a glass of champagne.  If the bartender already had it poured, it was probably warm or flat by that time anyway.  But the bakery was impressive.  So if you must see what all the hype is about, try the bakery to go.Recommendations for the restaurant:  Warm your bread before dropping it on the table, it will lead to bigger tips for your servers.  And hire a second bartender or a faster one for the lunch rush.","Long Beach, CA",2.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,8/3/2011,0,1,

I've gone 3 times and have yet to find something on their menu that I like. 1st trip - pasta2nd trip - chicken and a whole bunch of side items3rd trip - pizzaThe pasta was decent but the chicken was under cooked! I pointed this out to the server and he apologized and took it back to his kitchen. He later came back and apologized again after talking with the kitchen. But that was it. No manager and they didn't even take the chicken off my bill! That's such crap. I paid $15 for under cooked chicken that I couldn't eat and that they took away. 3rd time I went it was because I had no other choice. Friend's bday and she chose the place. Decided to order the pizza since that seems to be the item that everyone else was getting so I thought it was a safe bet. Adding the fire oven, you'd think that it'd have to be pretty amazing. Mediocre at best. I think I will stick to Pit fire pizza from now on.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,J W.,"Overrated.  I think people just get excited about this place cause its new-ish, in downtown, and looks kinda swanky.  Since downtown is undergoing a revival, the first pro place that moves in gets rave reviews on quality that would be considered lower tier anywhere else in LA.  The food is average-good, not fantastic.  The service is bad.  Servers who know people will come back even if they don't do a good job...so they don't.  The one main hostess on weekends is a stuck-up ____ (also happens to be really ugly, so maybe that explains her crappy attitude).I would go back for a to-go snack, but not for dinner, lunch, or brunch.  Not to mention, the acoustics are terrible in this place!  They should have sacrificed some of the faux marble on the walls for something that would absorb sound a little better.  Its like a sports bar atmosphere in a nice-looking restaurant.","Los Angeles, CA",2.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,1/21/2011,0,11,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,H C.,"My review is based from about a month ago so hopefully things have improved because I'm not sure where all these people eat - maybe everyone who has posted raving reviews is used to eating at the CPK level? The food is good but nothing spectacular or extraordinary. I think their portions are too big, which is why I think most people, (and this seems to be a common thing) think the food is reaallly good....it's good, but again, I don't get what the hype is all about. Maybe I expected more from reading all the reviews.The plus side is that there's an option for a dine-in in the downtown area that isn't CPK. They have alternatives and that is definitely a big plus. The space itself is beautiful to sit in - I do like their coffee very much  and they have a drink called the ""Green"" drink which is really nice to have first thing in the morning. Breakfast has meager case pickings throughout the week but I have not yet had their brunch menu. I've had some of their take away from their case and it seems someone has a sweet tooth in the kitchen! Everything I tried was slightly sweet - never really savory -- or bland. I can't explain it and I know it's hard to make food from a cold case taste good, but Tavern in Brentwood does a great job, and so does Joan's on Third with some of their items. I think they have some tweaking to do on their recipes. Drinks are good, but if you go across the street to 7 Grand or down to Cole's or the Golden Gopher, you can get the same style of mixology drinks, too.The pasta with bolognese and the sauce was not meaty tasting enough, and some of the pasta was undercooked. It was decent enough. We had the Pizza (Pepperoni) and the pie was decent - good but could be a bit thinner and crispier - not bad, and the tomato sauce was good. I don't understand about the Portobello fries - they were bland. The Calamari was not fresh tasting and too salty on the breading - although not greasy at all. The Roasted Beet Salad was good, with a good dressing. The marinated shrimp smelled a little ammoniated so although tasted ok, I decided to play safe and not pursue them any further. The service was decent but I think she checked on us just once. My friend got a box of the macarons on the way out and they were good but again, too sweet, the filling should be balanced with the macaron cookie. She also got a meatball sandwich to go for another friend of ours and he swears he got sick off of it! I will be back with a group of friends to explore the menu more and see about their sandwiches and some of the other pastries.","Santa Monica, CA",2.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,10/5/2009,0,3,

I asked the waiter to look at it and give me more so he brought me one more piece in a cup. Ok, fine. I'll deal with it, but then he had the nerve to charge me $4 for it!!! When i told him, he was super rude about it and was like ""what do you want me to do?"" but as soon as the manager coincidently walked in our direction, he decided to change his tone.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Mary L.,"3.5 Stars . Great place I totally adore it. I always come here for the atmosphere and deserts. I lowered the ratings since the food is very so so at the most. I don't mind paying their price but please fix the food, we tried couple entrées one of them was sea bass which was watery tasteless and more like a fast-food taste rather than a restaurant. Service is great here and I really liked our waiter. deserts are my favorites here, macaroons as advertised, I love em! thank you and pretty please fix the food ;)","Los Angeles, CA",3.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/-DkbjN8gO0-uTqsRE793kg/60s.jpg,3/5/2015,1,8,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Haley C.,"Not knocking the service because it did exist despite the hustle and bustle for this place. The cost for brunch is absurd. Maybe if it was a little more special I wouldn't complain. Maybe I didn't eat the right things (oatmeal and lemon ricotta pancakes), but still a hefty price tag. Not to mention the robustness of this restaurant. It is loud. I mean very loud. Overall the place is okay. I would not go back for brunch.

The end of the meal is upon us and awaiting the arrival of the cake we bought to come out. But instead of our cake making it's grand entrance, the server brings out some not so appealing chocolate blob. The surprise was ruined, as we had to remind the server in front of my cousin that we had brought our own dessert.

That was the only ""quick"" thing the whole evening. But, there is a difference between not rushing service and slow service. The idea of a leisurely meal is to enjoy company and it's difficult to carry on a conversation in this place. Reviewers have pointed this out and they are right.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Tim C.,"This place is so popular! And just a few words sum up the experience - Portobello Mushroom Fries! These were the best part and the saving grace for this spot.Entering to a wall of desserts and maccorons with the high ceilings and busy atmosphere, it couldn't be bad.  But this place was rather disappointing. Service was slow. We had a mixup with the order, in which the server said ""No, you said (enter wrong dish)"" after we had brought it up to her. No sense of being polite or anything which really irked me. One person asked to clarify if the sparkling water was complimentary and she looked at us and responded like we were idiots. I ordered the belgian waffles which I expected to come with a bunch of fruit, but it was two huge waffles and just a small handful of berries. The cream that came with it was the only thing that got me through the dish. We could tell later on that the waitress was trying to make up for her rudeness by trying to be nice to us but it was already too late. If it wasn't for the portobello fries this place would've been 2 stars for me.Others in my group enjoyed the eggs benedict though so fyi maybe the dishes are hit or miss.","Irvine, CA",3.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TsKCITV-gUr6l7SK_HI2mQ/60s.jpg,8/4/2014,132,113,42

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Cynthia R.,"Bottega Louie is really okay. it's pretty delicious, but super pricey. I went there on a Sunday and the place was packed.

Definitely a must.Then back to the sub-par linguini. Not much to say other then meah.Service was pretty bad, our waitress seemed to not care at all and was just pouring water into the cups without picking up the glass so I had to move. Usually not a stickler about service but being a former server my self, I know when someone is trying to be rude. But everyone has a bad day so not that big of a deal, but just a warning.I mainly came here to get the macarons for friends and family, and everyone that received them from me loved it to death. But hoooolllyyy it is expensive. 13 piece box, 3x 5 piece box= around $80.

But it is just too loud :(  I think it is the type of place where someone who wishes to be seen by everyone goes. The food isn't anything to write home about. If I want Italian, I know where to get real Italian. The dessert section, I must admit, is pretty gorgeous. All the colorful maccaroons are a feast for the eyes, not so much the palate, but they are good... The eclairs, omg the eclairs are a little piece of heaven, both, the cherry & pistachio!!...

Desserts galore.Lose: Loud, crowded, noisy, can't hear your date or have a proper conversation environment. The way the building is massively shaped creates the most incredible echo and sound wave frequencies imaginable. If I was at an orchestra concert it would be perfect. Unfortunately, I was there for dinner.It is good for big dinner parties where people just end up screaming over each other anyway I guess.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Steven A.,"Given the number of great reviews I have to say I was expecting crazy good.  What I found was not bad to just OK.  Service was friendly but not remarkable.  Food was a mix of flavors and toppings that didn't work well together.  Then we get to the macaroons, which is the real reason I came here.  It's one of my weaknesses that I can't resist.  One of my favorite French indulgences.  But wait, is this a French restaurant?  Hmmm.  That's weird but OK, given the reviews I let that slide and ordered.  So, they were edible but not wonderful.  Kind of flat actually.  I've had way better but if you haven't tried as many as I have over the years then I'm sure you will think they are quite remarkable.  Personally, I wasn't impressed enough to say I'm coming back for more.","Los Angeles, CA",3.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/CnsL791qVXGITHG_-Bam_w/60s.jpg,12/16/2012,73,22,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Abigail H.,"I decided to give this place another try and it only went up to a 3.5 but still no 4 star. We went with a big group for a birthday and I was able to try quite a few dishes. SOUPS:Onion Gratinee: It was good, not great. The cheese wasn't melted but just a big chewy glob and it was a bit thick for me. Chicken Brodo:I originally ordered the Onion Gratinee and swapped it for this soup with Santa Tsai because I wanted something lighter,. it was just ok. Traditional chicken broth with dumpling type pasta. SALAD: Modena Salad: This was the best dish in my opinion of the bunch. Loved it! PIZZA: Margherita: It was good... but then again, how can you mess this up. Clam: It wasn't salty and pretty good. I would recommend and the rest of our group loved this. PASTA:Pappardell: Mushroom and truffle and I actually liked this a lot. But then again, I love the 2 main ingredients. Tagliatelle Bolognese: Again, I don't think you can mess this up so it was good. Hope that helps. For me, I've tried amazing pastas in New York so this was just okay. I will probably end up going back with a group but I will not be the one to suggest it.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Shelby L.,"This restaurant is aesthetically very pretty & is located in the old Brooks Brothers location. We got seated almost immediately. And then it hit me, the NOISE in this place is almost unbearable. I literally could not hear the person sitting across from me without awkwardly lurching over the table the entire night. While this may be okay for people that don't give a crap about engaging with the people you're having dinner with, it sucks when you actually try to enjoy other peoples company. So, points off there. The hostess was a bit of an awkward bimbo, but the service was really great. Honestly, I would have been happy to just eat my entire meal solely based on the appetizer menu. The bruschetta was delicious. The actual pizza I ordered was so lack luster in flavor I was literally momentarily confused. Whatever. The prices were decent. Basically, this place has the potential to be great, but its lacking in major areas that are essential to enjoying a meal (ie: being able to hear the people you're with & having the proper savory taste that Italian deserves) but for just drinks/happy hour this place would be A+","Los Angeles, CA",3.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/QY64ZPdaEtgptulX1jaBFw/60s.jpg,9/8/2010,0,4,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Lilly C.,"Been wanting to try Bottega Louie for a while but every time plans did not work out.  I finally tried it out this past weekend because my two best friends treated me out for my birthday :"")  I love the way the restaurant is set up, everything is so clean and open.  It adds a sense of freshness and depth.  The prices were very accommodating to my wallet, but that may be on par with the size of the servings.  Margherita Pizza- probably the most bang for your buck.  6 pretty big slices, this should fill you up.Portobello Fries- these fried mushrooms are an interesting flavor and texture.  Lightly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  They are pretty good but after ~5, I could not eat anymore.Lobster Manicotti- don't be too surprised (as I was) when you get one, small lonely piece on a small dish....Modena Salad- I loved this salad!  The candied walnuts and the balsalmic vinaigrette are in perfect harmony with the butter lettuce and the goat cheese is the creamiest goat cheese I've ever had!Le Grand Macaron- Probably my favorite part of the meal.  The macaron is definitely bigger than the small ones they sell in boxes, rest assured.  There is ice cream in the middle and all sorts of berries.. yum!It took us a long time to get seated because I think they forgot about us after they asked us to sit at the bar.. but the service was friendly and the food comes out quick!  Because the restaurant is so open, the noise level is very loud, I was almost shouting the entire dinner and sometimes could not hear what my friends were saying.  The absolute best part about Bottega Louie is the macarons.  They are $24 for a large box but I came up with a free box!  Don't ask how ;)  I've never had a macaron before and when I took my first bite, my eyes LIT up and were sparkling!  They are the most delightful, splendid cookies you'll ever try.  Slightly cripsy, yet soft, yet chewy.. they leave a fragrant taste behind.. it's almost indescribable in words.  Just for the macarons I want to give this place 4 stars, but the food was just 3 stars.  :/Valet, which is located behind the restaurant, is $6....","Los Angeles, CA",3.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/STAEQrl5vt3o7VkumjocHQ/60s.jpg,9/8/2010,352,549,237

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Chris P.,"I guess I don't get it.  This place has all the charm of a Venetian laboratory.  The food is decent but it seems as if everyone is taking crazy pills when it comes to this place.  It's different, it makes you feel as if you are actually in a city, which holds some validity in LA, but come on!  This is nothing of mention except for the novelty and the fact that it's one of the few places where you can see a huge employee to guest ratio, but that doesn't make the food or the experience any better.  This is a true product of the recession and lowered expectations.","Los Angeles, CA",3.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/qubS9Fpw2i72DWATOw_G1g/60s.jpg,7/27/2009,0,2,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Arre P.,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this charming restaurant, and I must say it was a delightful experience. The ambiance was warm and inviting, with tasteful decorations that added to the overall appeal of the place. The menu, though concise, offered a carefully curated selection of dishes, ensuring that each item was prepared with the utmost attention to detail.One dish that truly stood out was the tartufo pizza. Topped with egg and prosciutto, it was a delightful twist on the classic pizza, and the combination of flavors was simply divine. The richness of the prosciutto paired perfectly with the creamy egg, creating a unique and delicious blend that left me craving for more.What I appreciated most about the restaurant was the focus on quality over quantity. Despite having a limited number of options on the menu, each dish was crafted with care and precision, showcasing the chef's culinary expertise. The staff was attentive and friendly, making the dining experience even more enjoyable.The location of the restaurant was also a plus, conveniently located in a bustling area, making it a perfect spot for a casual lunch or a cozy dinner. While there are other dining options nearby, this restaurant truly stands out for its well-executed dishes and inviting atmosphere.Overall, I had a fantastic dining experience, and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a delightful culinary adventure in a beautiful setting.As if the savory dishes weren't enough, the pastry selection at this restaurant is an absolute treat! After enjoying a satisfying lunch or dinner, indulging in their delectable pastries is a must. From decadent cakes to delicate pastries, their dessert menu offers a wide array of options to satisfy every sweet tooth. Each pastry is made with skill and passion, evident in every delightful bite. The combination of rich flavors and exquisite presentation makes for a truly memorable end to a wonderful dining experience. Whether you have a penchant for chocolate delights or prefer fruity tarts, their pastry selection has something to please every palate. It's safe to say that their pastries are nothing short of heavenly, and I highly recommend leaving some room for dessert to truly complete the dining journey at this exceptional restaurant.","Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,7/31/2023,0,1,3

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Douglas K.,"So, I've heard rave reviews about this place And I was working in the area so I decided to finally give it a shot for lunch. I called ahead to make sure lunch reservations weren't required, and they weren't. I spoke to a really nice woman on the phone also named Michelle and we had a brief conversation about her favorite food items that I should eat. I walked inside and was quickly seated. They brought water immediately and placed the piece of bread in the center of my small table. I ordered the ""Calabrese"" Pizza by recommendation and since I'm pescatarian, ordered it with no salami. I also ordered the gazpacho.The bread was good, however it wasn't warm like I thought it would be and the butter was refrigerated, so really hard to spread. I asked my waitress for some soft butter and she brought some back in no time! I was still kind of sad the bread wasn't warm but I got over that pretty quickly when the gazpacho arrived. They placed a large white bowl in front of me with flowers and herbs on the side and a man with what looked like a wine decanter poured the gazpacho into the bowl. It was a very cool experience and the gazpacho was absolutely delicious. The pizza blew me away way more than I thought it was going to. The spicy with the mixture of the honey drizzle on top was absolute perfection. The best part about lunch by myself here, having plenty of leftovers for later. I look forward to coming back and will update if my experience exceeds my expectations.","Downtown, Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jKv515kvzR5UDg9aQVQSAQ/60s.jpg,7/28/2022,19,13,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jen A.,"Definitely worth a visitI've been here many times before. Beautiful space, however, super loud as the acoustics are awful! Prepare to wait... even though the space is huge it's always busy. Love the table bread they give you. The mushroom pizza was good and so was the arugula salad but we didn't care for the chicken Milanese.... could be better. Service is a little lagging felt like there were not enough waiters.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Chris R.,"Food is good and service is usually great. Bottega has been a staple downtown for a upscale/fancy dinner for 10+ years and shows now signs of slowing.

Even if youre going in for just dessert, you can seat yourself at a table. The service is really on point as well.They have a open kitchen design, for sure one day, ill have dinner here.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Emily B.,"Bottega Louie - PASTA LA VISTA, BABY!Lynn BentleyOverwhelmed with the city noise of downtown LA, I walked into the high-end crossroads of Italian and French cuisine, where the lights were dimmed. I escaped the car horns and winds from outside, to walk into another chaotic hub. It was almost like a movie theater, yet the voices of the diners were booming. It was the equivalent of walking into the Disney movie, Ratatouille. Waiters in white button-ups and black ties, not one hair was misplaced on their heads. Walking in, it was clear the diners were the priority. The waiters gravitated towards anyone who didn't seem satisfied, checking on them and their experience. I could tell that their goal was efficiency and swiftness. I was seated immediately, even if it was in a corner. It was surprising not having to wait for a table, with the popularity and quality of the restaurant, I'd expect a herd of guests queuing. In fact, there was no seating area to wait for a table to open up, does anyone ever wait at Bottega Louie? Scanning the arranged tables and booths, not one contempt face was seen. Conversations from every table flooded the cold marble interior. The high and open ceilings provided more space for the voices to collide and gather, so loud it sounded like inaudible white noise. Occasionally, high pitched sounds of fire truck sirens would overpower the voices as they sped by, their flashing lights illuminating the large windows and turning the white marble to red. Throughout dining, I felt like royalty. Yet, at certain points it turned to the feeling of being babysat by these waiters, caring so much that it became overwhelming. Asking how the food was when it barely got to my table, looking for smiles and approval, which I did give. The waiters moved purposely and knew what they needed to do, as if it were a choreographed dance, moving swiftly past each other on the marble dance floor. They maneuvered around Gucci purses dangling from the back of women's chairs and people standing to take pictures of their party who posed and smiled in their seats. In this rich sea of people, no two groups of people looked the same. It was a boiling pot of races, ages, genders, tourists, and locals. Our waiter, Molly, clearly had a goal to make us, and all other patrons, special and important. One negative facial expression, and Molly was there to provide and mend. Unfortunately, Molly couldn't fix the struggles of elderly people at tables around, pulling out their iPhone flashlights to read the menu. The dim lighting could be mistaken for a photographer's dark room. Bottega Louie will make a dent in your wallet and quite frankly, your retina. Bank account and eye damage aside, the pasta set before me brought the sensation of being in a sauna as the steam drifted up onto my face. Too hot to eat, I turned my attention towards the abstract bread on the table which looked like a wonky snake, ready to be torn apart. Next to it sat a metal contraption, holding up french fries, sprinkled with parsley with a variety of dipping sauces. The bread and french fry contraption were oddly compelling, but when the orecchiette pasta finally reached my mouth, some enthusiasm was lost. Although the sausage and artichoke mixed in added tang and, might I say, notoriety, the pasta itself was lackluster. Without the spice that came along with the artichoke and sausage, it alone would put me to sleep. A pasta connoisseur myself, high expectations were held for this $22 orecchiette which ultimately broke my bank account and heart. Determined for redemption, I ordered mint chip gelato, and was pleasantly surprised and my spirits were lifted. For some reason, this gelato just made sense to me as I tasted not one hint of artificiality in the spoonfuls. A hot chocolate with symmetrical blocks of homemade marshmallows might've been an odd choice following gelato, but I had no regrets when my spoon disrupted the foam on top. I went in not knowing what to expect and walked out with gratitude and anticipation for my next visit at this crossroads of Italian and French cuisine.","Westchester, Westchester, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,2/15/2019,0,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jay G.,Came with a friend for a Sunday brunch. Parked in a garage structure on Grand and 7th (literally across from the restaurant) normally $7. with validation from Bottega we got a $2 discount. They got our name and number and texted us when our table was ready. They estimated 20min wait time; we waited for 5min and we got seated really quick. The hostess and waitress were so kind and informative! Expect to pay between $8-20 on a plate depending if you order a small plate or a brunch plate. All the drinks looked phenomenal!! I got the potato pancakes which is savory and cooked with green onion in the batter and it came with a sour cream-type sauce and applesauce. Perfect portion and satisfyingly filling (if you're not ravenous) My friend ordered the avocado toast came with cuts of  sausage on top.

The atmosphere is lively and energetic. The place gets a little loud but that doesn't really bother me. The wait staff was attentive and professional and made the meal that much more enjoyable. Besides the difficulty parking (it is downtown LA) everything went smoothly. We didn't have to wait in line because we were only a party of two but I've heard the waits can get fairly long.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Elliot P.,"His is one of my favorite places in Downtown LA, a not-so-hidden gem, that's a real treat to dine in! I love the ambiance- it's big, open, like a huge New York flat. The interior is classy and sophisticated with white marbles, gold accents, infused with the old charms of the building it is in. I also love their Portobello fries! I cant start my meal without that appetizer! And their thin crust pizzas with exotic flavors like clams are really good ! Their famous macaroons are a must have. Almost any new cafe or boutique in LA is trying to come up with their own versions of macaroons, but theirs really tastes amazing. Waiters too look so elegant they might be actors moonlighting as waiters. Overall it is a good place for brunch or dinner that has its own charm.","South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/f5DAnbgqMAhKYuXgv86PbQ/60s.jpg,6/19/2018,2,4,1

At night the ambiance is set thanks to the candle light of each table and the dim lights of the place.It get really crowed, so I would recommend get there with time to get in the waiting list and spent some time looking at the cute pastries or after dinner rush hour.We got there a little late so there were a lot of available tables. The staff greeting us and took us to our table right away. I order the Chicken Parmesan and my boyfriend the lasagna. But to be honest regretted my choice after watching one of the chefs tossing the dough in the pizza station, their pizzas look amazing and in my next visit, you can bet I will order one.Unfortunately the pastry section was closed at the end of our dinner, but it was because it was quite late when we left, and we were one of the few people still in the restaurant.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/PC3pVrQxMZ7USL3vatGN2A/60s.jpg,2/13/2018,36,3,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Chris H.,"I came here for dinner one night on a date.  She picked the place and I was pleased (I wasn't even that displeased when the check came.)  It's a big restaurant, but you can hear yourself talk, and the size of the room means you have some valuable elbow room.I was my usual boring self and opted for the Margherita Pizza.  I realize I probably made myself look like a total nerd for ordering it, but I can say that it was good, as tomato and cheese pizzas go.  It's definitely a $25 restaurant pizza, and not a $12 pizzeria pizza, and, if you like that kind of thing, you'll like the one at Bottega Louie.  I tried the crab beignets for an appetizer.  They sounded more exciting than they turned out to be.Cocktails aren't my thing, so, when it came time to start out with one, I couldn't resist ordering something the menu called a Smog-City Saber-Toothed Squirrel Amber.  (I just looked it up on their website to make sure I got the name right.)  Maybe I should explain that it's a beer.  A good one, not too heavy, but a lot more flavorful than standard beer.  I'm just not sure where the squirrel comes in.I'd like to have tried a dessert (the beignets were calling to me off the menu), but my date was the type that had just come from the gym and avoided carbs after 6:00.  Maybe that's what made me order beer and a pizza.Maybe that's why I ended up having a dish of ice cream at home alone half an hour after I'd paid the check.  But that's not Bottega Louie's fault.","Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/WPCxGhh6yTGcb5wbQWwAPg/60s.jpg,7/18/2017,1,13,

Inside was busy, but they were able to get us a table for party of 8.I ordered Fried Calamari, Cestini Gamber(pasta). Fried calamari tasted little bit old, it also came almost witin 4 minutes after we place the order. It might be sitting there for someone i donno but still taste ok! On the other hand Cestini Gamber was just perfect. The basil gives an amazing flavor and  is a great match with Shrimp.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/89lO_CY9qU-hQ1Ec6d-ZAw/60s.jpg,5/30/2017,0,6,2

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Chris O.,"Please see my full review on my blog...I visited Bottega Louie for the fist time this last weekend. The entire staff is very polite and friendly. Going at the ""wrong"" time will force you to wait a little while for a table as there are many people that go here for brunch, but it is easy to grab a drink while you wait.We ordered mimosas and a couple beers to drink. The mimosas were pretty standard and I would probably try a different cocktail next time.To eat, we ordered the mac & cheese, Lobster Hash, Burrata pizza, and macarons. The mac & cheese was excellent. I would probably go with a different pizza next time and the Lobster Hash, while good, had little lobster and an overbearing taste of potatoes.The macarons are amazing! We ordered 8 for here and 8 to go. My favorite was the birthday cake and salted caramel. Overall, I would visit the restaurant again. However, I would probably make a few different food choices for the main course.","Redondo Beach, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/6ER0ffz2xi4vVLiairoYww/60s.jpg,5/9/2017,0,18,23
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Ivan C.,"_____SERVICE_____For the macaroons there is not much of a service. You get the fill-in sheet and select which flavors you wish to purchase. Then hand it to one of the workers._____PRICE_____Man the price here can depend on what you get. The macaroons are $2.50 each. Even when they give you the bundle up price. It still adds up to $2.50 each - don't gotta do the math, I gotchu._____PRESENTATION_____The place is big and spacious. When I went it wasn't as busy so it was chill._____LOCATION/PARKING_____My peeps let me tell you, free parking will be difficult if you don't go at night and find an open meter. You'll have to pay at the meters or close by parking lots._____MEMORABLE MOMENT_____Trying to find cheap/free parking to get to this place lol, good luck!","Whittier, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ALBJTee6AHJk39RdryDLJQ/60s.jpg,4/22/2017,630,71,139

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Oliver C.,"First time at Bottega Louie today! After years of hearing about their French macarons (not macaroons, please!), I finally decided to stop by as I was in the neighborhood for the day. First impression: they're obviously super popular as the place was PACKED. I had a quick lunch: egg benedict (delicious... but how can't you get such a simple dish right?) and quiche Lorraine slice. The quiche was ok. Not bad, but nothing like they taste in Paris. I guess it's just a matter of what ingredients you're using but it tasted more like bacon than like Parisian ham (probably because it was bacon...).Best part of my lunch were the French macarons... Not as precisely baked as the ones I got from Laduree's on the Champs Elysees, but clearly the best I've had in Los Angeles. The pistachio and Earl Grey ones are especially delicious, both with intense aromas, crusty shells and chewy interiors... Magnifique!Parking: valet is the best option.","San Diego, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/r2ySlkhSiUEclE8BECd9nA/60s.jpg,11/23/2016,3,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Adrienne K.,"Such a fun tourist spot.  A must for LA visitors who are looking for a bustling, sexy French Bistro with an Italian influence.  My friend and I ordered two glasses of the Michel Chapoutier Belleruche Rosé, the Caesar salad, the smoked trout rillettes, the Cestini Gamber, the crab beignets and the grilled octopus.  Our favorite dishes were the trout rillettes and the Cestini Gamber, though the other dishes were tasty.The food is delicious given the volume the kitchen produces.  The price point is appropriate given the portion sizes.  Strong wine list that pairs nicely with the menu.  Loved the market in the front with the beautifully designed packaging of the take out bags and such.A very sexy and energetic space.  The only down side was the service.  We found that our server didn't properly pronounce the dishes, nor was he knowledgeable about the wine list. Luckily, my friend and I are very knowledgeable about food and wine so we were able to create a fun dining experience in spite of our server's lack of knowledge.Well work the visit.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,8/16/2016,0,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Luigi G.,"CONTEMPORARY GLORIFICATION OF MACARON__________________________________________Spirituality practice needs qualified celebration space, and Bottega Louie is the glorification place of Macaron.  High ceiling, elegant Carrara's marble everywhere, open and wide light spaces for bar and restaurant, large and exposed kitchen and pizza oven. As a modern pagan temple, wide as an Apple store, but more elegant, larger than a Tesla showroom, with less technology and ascendant inspirational white from the ubiquitous marble to the ceiling, the concept of contemporary neoclassicism has found in downtown LA its most celebrated food: The Macaron. Yesterday I went for brunch in Bottega Louise and how to skip pizza with Burrata e Prosciutto crudo?  The topping were genuine and the base well cooked, but missing the flavor of wood oven. So I went to verify and yes, sadly, they have an oven with gas fire! So bad..Anyhow, I came here mainly for the Macarons, French sweet meringue filled with buttercream of various flavors. Macaron are ""derived"" from the Italian Macaroni (with the ""i"" at the end) invented in Florence in middle age time, 500 years ago. ""Ossi di Morto"" (bones of the dead) from Tuscany are a popular version of Macaroni, crunchier than Macaron and without filling. ""Baci di Dama"" (Lady's Kisses) from Liguria are more similar to French Macaron (also because Liguria confines with French), but they comes in 2 types only (chocolate and vanilla) and they are much less sweet, so you can eat more without feeling ready for dialysis. Not an expert of Macaron though; I had a few here and there, but this time I wanted to go big, so I ordered 15 flavors to taste all of them! I really enjoyed Coconut and Pistachio! The Salted Caramel is really nasty (but this is my personal opinion), all the Chocolate ones can be skipped away. I understand Rose and Violet Cassis are graceful. But, honestly, 15 are too many ... last night I couldn't sleep!  So this morning I called my personal MD (my sister in Italy) asking how did it happen and she explained that is a normal reaction to high sugar in blood.. never happened before! And I've never seen Macaron in Italy too and she told me that a few years ago they tried hard to market them, however they last only a few seasons. Her explanation was simple: comparing side to side Macaron and Macaroni, Macaron fails in both taste and price! And actually Macaron are based on low cost ingredients, but for some magical marketing reason their price is stellar: $3.00 each.  Yes, Paul told me that on Earl Grey they put real edible gold, but it doesn't explain the price of the others. In any case gold is an heavy metal that can only damage my kidney, so why should I eat it? Another marketing magic nonsense!In my opinion, the reason they are so popular in the US, especially among women, is because they are sickly sweet, colorful, and light in weight so - apparently - having less calories, making you feel less guilty than eating a cup cake for example.Bottega Louie is an interesting and elegant place, fun bar, super clean, kind of noisy (I noticed no sound absorbent panels are in the ceiling), pizza is not excellent, espresso is very bitter, but Macarons are perfect in the sense of how they are supposed to be!4.9 for Macaron quality 4.8 for ambient 3.5 for the noise 1.0 for the primitive use of edible gold in Earl Grey (it is toxic)3.55, rounded 4 StarsLuigius - Thor of Yelp Energy________________________Amy N.'s Best Review (Self-Evaluated on 5/17/2016) : ","Costa Mesa, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/dUQJl72YOTpPcRcW8ALiHA/60s.jpg,5/22/2016,416,65,752

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jacob Y.,"Took the fiancée here for an early Valentine's Day, and it was a positive experience overall.The food was really nice.  For starters we shared the Lobster nage, which is a clear lobster - infused broth with bits of lobster, this crazy rectangular 'sheet' of cauliflower (don't ask - no idea how they turned a vegetable into a thin sheet), raisins, and almonds.We also shared a side of their truffle mashed potatoes, which was heaven.  Familiar comfort food with a touch of sophistication.  Nice.Then came the tagliatelle Bolognese.  The pasta was made fresh, but seemed undercooked.  It was really doughy and chewy as I ate it, although the modest - looking serving was deceptively filling.The Margherita pizza came last and we only managed a slice each before deciding to take it home in a box (I had it for lunch the next day, and it was GOOD!).Finished the meal off with a passion fruit sorbet. Love sorbets.  She went with the Pavlova, a blueberry meringue pastry with fluffy passion fruit cream on the inside.  Just excellent.Now while the food was solidly good overall, the undercooked pasta knocks it down a half-star for me.  The other half-star penalty us for the service and ambiance. It wasn't an issue with our server who was a nice girl - but the other guys who served us alongside her.  One practically threw one of our dishes on the table before asking ""you want cheese with that?"".  I wanted to ask him to ask me that again in the same tone while looking me in the eye, but I kept my mouth shut.  The bro-ski wasn't worth the trouble.  If I wanted the 'by-the-slice' NYC pizzeria attitude I would've gone to one! Whatever man...The other knock is the ambiance, or the lack thereof.  Not really romantic, but more of a buzzy vibe.  The lighting wasn't the issue, but the cavernous ceilings and mostly bare walls basically makes the entire restaurant a large ECHO CHAMBER.  THE clamor of the throngs of people on the waitlist loitering around the front/bakery area wasn't helping, either.Not wanting to end it on a low note we stopped at the macaron counter to get a box of them.  Got the 13-count box, and we chose: 1 mango, 4 rose, 4 earl grey, and 4 cassis.  All were outstanding, reminiscent of the Ladurée macarons I tried in Paris with my fiancée. Nice!","Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/eM1URFTZDKl6Mpib1TJxTg/60s.jpg,2/22/2016,2,23,17

The best part of the meal was the potabella mushroom fries. Very unique and addicting. The worst part, sorry to say, were the macaroons.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,John P.,"We got here on Saturday afternoon and the place was packed.  We were told it would be about 45 mins for a table. Since we weren't starving and there was filming downtown with a few street closures that would have had us driving around almost that long to get a meal, we decided to stick around. We ""only"" had to wait 30 mins.The quality of food and service was excellent. I had the Trenne with rib eye which was very good. My dinner partner had the Casareccia and it was excellent.  We split the Creme Brulee which was amazing, one of the best I've had. Bottega Louie is a must do when downtown.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,10/4/2015,0,13,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Hanley C.,"In all honesty, I am a huge fan of their pasta and pizzas. It is a great restaurant, HOWEVER, the thing that keeps me from actually making my way out there is the parking. DTLA parking is not only terrible, but really really $$$$$. With all these courier / delivery apps out there, I tend to choose the comfort of my home (I usually go with RushOrder app (not sure if still valid but try promo code HUNGRY3 for a couple bucks off) - especially after some poor experiences with the other apps out there). Even with the delivery fee & tip, I'd probably be paying more for a stinking parking spot out there. ANYWAY on to the food. They do have a seasonal menu, but there are many core items that are always there. When I order with my friends, we usually get a bunch of stuff and share. The arugula salad and modena salad are very good salads to go with your other items. The mac and cheese with bacon, duck prosciutto corstini, and  portobello fries (so good) were what we went with the last time we ordered for delivery. As for the pizza, I've tried the margherita and the sausage pizza which are all very good (cheesy, thin crisp crust, etc). Just typing this out is getting my super hungry and to avoid the wot, i'll stop here.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Urd89AukQYe25IH80PNqKw/60s.jpg,9/29/2015,2,182,1

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jeannine C.,"A notorious eatery in DTLA. As many other have noted, the noise level is intense so not the best choice for a romantic date or long conversation with a friend over food. The food though is so beyond good. The macroons will be, if not already, legendary and food like the pizza and brunch items are out of this world. Fortunately, the service is also some of the best I have ever encountered which offsets the noisiness of the place.

But not as good as other places I tried before ..  I would give these macaroons a 7.5-8 but it's definitely up there.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,4/8/2015,6,2,

If you can get over the crowd and the cliche-ness of this spot, you'll enjoy it.  Really intimate, really busy.  You MUST have a reservation.  Don't set yourself up for failure and, although the wait for it is 20 minutes, do NOT miss your chance to try their soufflé.  I didn't get anything to eat and didn't need to, because the soufflé made up for it.

Their portobello mushroom chips with the aioli sauce is soo worth it. Also, get the souffle, but purchase it. Regardless of the ambiance that is large, it's exceptionally loud. You will be yelling across the table most of the time.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,David H.,"Thank you, David F. for bringing me to this place.  I've had this bookmarked for over a year but didn't want to go through the hassle of getting lost in the one way streets of DTLA and then looking or paying for a parking spot so I never went.  Its so nice to just sit back and relax while someone else does the driving for you.  Especially after a long day at work. I might come back to give their Eggs Benedict a try one of these days.  The pictures look so yummy.And absolutely not a great place for your first date unless if you don't mind yelling over the din.  Or if you're fine with staying quiet and gazing longingly into your date's eyes which I must point out is creepy if it IS your first date.My only negative about this place is that it's so expensive for lunch that I'd not go again unless I were to be the guest of someone, as I was for this afternoon.  I can see how it could get very loud with a large crowd - my advice is to go during the off hours; the staff is available, the food delicious, it's clean and lovely.  Just make sure you have deep pockets!","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/97IXw19b9Nd5imwrro_cHQ/60s.jpg,7/11/2014,1,5,

Their pizza's are delicious, The brunch is also very tasty, their pastries are fantastic and they cocktails are mixed very well. I would give it 5 stars but their service lacks a bit. Not very quick, attentive or always the friendliest. And its always SO busy in there. But even though there are a few downsides, if I have the chance to stop by, I will even if its just to pick up a few macaroons.  I think the tall ceilings are awesome, but that makes the place super loud, especially when its packed.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Marcus M.,"Words may fall short while scribbling my experience here. Ah, brunch at Bottega Louie was simply fanciful, absolute no doubt in any case. Came here with my family last night and whoa - this spot literally pulled all the right chords in swaying all us away, especially my mother (Mom, you still look so blithe). Well, Bottega sports minimalistic designing that speaks elegance and sheer brilliance without a doubt. Loved the natty seating arrangement, especially the wide space (some might find it more like a huge hall though). But yeah, minimal interior is what this one carries, which off course got thumbs up from me.Cuisines were quite delish, bobbed up in a filling portion. We had a lot of options from its Sunday brunch - and let me say 'quite a treat on taste buds'. Macrons and Portobello Fries were too scrumptious, just makes you fork out a bit extra than you'd want to. But still, so damn worth every single penny!

I didn't feel like I wasted too much money and the food was good I liked it. Now true I not picky about food and I get that so maybe im not like other people who judge food because to me food is good but then again this place has good food come on so I think it's fair to make the claim that this place has good food then.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/zmo79mHCTzziuu3oO6PFIQ/60s.jpg,10/9/2013,23,10,4

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Amanda W.,We recently spent a week in Los Angeles and stayed downtown for the first few days. We got the recommendation to try Bottega Louie and we're glad we went.The restaurant has an incredible market with take-home entrees and a great assortment of baked goods and desserts!We had a great waiter which really helped. I originally wanted the Chicken Milanese but they were out. So I went with the Mussels & Clams. The highlight of the evening was definitely the Portobello Fries - highly recommend. The pizzas looked really good - as we saw several pass by. We tried the chops as well - which were incredible including the apple sauce that came with it.Definitely save room for dessert. There is an awesome chocolate souffle - be sure to order in advance. We didn't know so we went with a Peanut Butter Terrine - that was a combination of my favorite things peanut butter & chocolate.Our waiter sent back the a dish because it wasn't done right originally so he sent us home with a mini pound cake with cherries - so good!Definitely recommend a visit.,"Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/l4bxItzeIGtiKJ-AgmI2gw/60s.jpg,10/2/2013,17,6,3

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jesse S.,"This spot gets a solid 4. The decor from the outside to inside is very modern and hip. Frankly it's like out of some manhattan neighborhood and I love New York so that is fine with me. The crowd most often is very yuppie in keeping with the shift of DTLA. And it gets quite loud. The wait is usually 30 minutes for the main section but you can sit in the section near the bakery as self seating.The food is very good, no disappointments here. And the baked goods look as good as they taste or taste as good as they look. It's like little edible artwork.I'd say the prices are reasonable and what you would expect from the place, maybe even a little less expensive than I was expecting. The reason it's not 5 stars is the noise factor. It's like a night club where you have to lean in and yell to the person who is like 1 foot away.","Westlake, Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/jaTbARha-OXn7HrycyYPpQ/60s.jpg,8/23/2013,490,56,13

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Liz P.,Everything I've ordered here not only tastes yummy but like it wasn't made in a restaurant - like it was made for you in someone's kitchen. Usually when the server says 'everything's good' you know they're full of it - not so here :)Prices are slightly higher then average but the portion sizes are MUCH higher than average and you often get a choice of a side or 2.Don't get me started on the bakery case - they make everything fresh on-site and really tests my willpower when I walk by it - probably not a good thing if like me you are trying to watch your waistline!,"Brooklyn, NY",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/QFLgor8RIKJhdzJq042BIA/60s.jpg,7/15/2013,0,4,

Of course that they a lot of other selection aside from macaroons for desserts.  Recently we had a party and I ordered sets of 6 macaroons for guests as party favors.  Each of the boxes were boxed beautifully in lavender and with a signature white ribbon.Location wise is close to the Staples Center, so it's definitely a happening location if you want to go to places nearby afterwards.  However on the downside, the popular location is also a reason for the Long Wait.They do Not take any reservations, so if you are not there in the beginning you mostly have to wait an hour especially peak times like Saturday night.","El Monte, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/aNZiwncJUHQIeRGwr7zQRg/60s.jpg,6/11/2013,188,40,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Ben C.,"I only heard about this place through friends and family and the basic themes were this: great ambiance, great food, sort of loud, excellent macaroons. On those notes, Bottega did no disappoint. I had a an order of Portobello Mushroom Fries and shared the Margherita pizza. Both were excellent and something unique that I have not tasted before. Also, the macaroons. Pretty awesome. Service was good. The only knock I would have about this place is that it is kind of loud, so if you wanted to have meaningful conversations with your significant other, it might be tough. All in all, I would definitely come back again.","Upland, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/lK-UWHqOr2AF71v2Pc6gvg/60s.jpg,12/11/2012,0,7,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jillian C.,"I absolutely LOVE this place! The space is fantastic and always buzzing like something in New York City. Be warned though, it's very loud in here but the food is great! I highly recommend the French Onion Soup and Modena Salad! Try not to fill up on the delicious baguette they place on the table because you can easily eat the entire loaf before your food even arrives. The servers are not the most personable and can even be a bit stuffy and rude but I guess that's to be expected in such a fast paced and loud environment. For dessert you must try the Butterscotch Budino. It's worth every calorie!  They also have an amazing pastry case with authentic French style macaroons and other beautiful dessert reminiscent of Laduree in Paris.","Ladera Ranch, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/vqX7Av-XlH075-tJYZqgvg/60s.jpg,11/10/2012,0,3,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Elena L.,"I came to this place for lunch, dinner, and to buy party favors. All times did not disappoint.  We usually wait for half an hour on a weekend.  Bottega Louie has a pastry sandwich section that sells macarons, cakes, pastries..french and italian.  Their packaging for macarons are beautiful.  One time I pre ordered ahead of time for a party and they did not have it ready.  I was also in a rush so i let them know ahead of time. They had to prepare the 20 favors in front of me. To apologize they gave me 2 free macaroon.  This is why I cannot give them a 5.  Other than that, I have not been disappointed.  The quality of their food is Delish!  Pizza, smoked salmon benedict, portobello fries., calamari..list goes on..Parking need metered parking usually.  Came here both times with bigger groups.  It is not meant for an intimate romantic setting.  It is a fun loud setting.  Anywhoo..nothing to complain about their food and baked goods.  Very tasty.","Whittier, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,7/31/2012,16,10,

The pancakes, french toast, beignet, portobello fries, margherita pizza, and fresh squeezed juices are my top picks. The staff is extremely welcoming and the service is fast.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,6/24/2012,0,66,

Ordered the Portobello fries, Bianco Pizza, Tagliatelle Bolognese Pasta, Fettucine Belmondo, Pork Chops, and the Chocolate Souffle for dessert. - Loved the Tagliatelle Bolognese Pasta. Probably my favorite there besides the Pork Chops. - Got some macaronis to go at the dessert bar afterwards. Love that they have unconventional flavors. - I've only been to this restaurant for dinners, but I imagine it'd be a perfect place to have a nice brunch or lunch. Cons: - They don't take reservations and it took us about 45 minutes to get seated. - Parking. Had to park valet after not being able to find any street parking. But I guess that's how it is for most restaurants in DTLA. - Too loud.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,5/17/2012,0,6,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Brian L.,"When I first walked into this restaurant, I wasn't mind blown.  It was more like...  Uhhh...  what kind of place is this??  Let me explain.  When you walk it, you see bakery/cafe area, bar area, kitchen prep area where you can see the chef prepare food, and restaurant area.  As you settle into the environment, you realize it's actually fun.  Now, I sat on a restaurant side and ordered pizza and salad.  Yea, a pizza.  I did it because everybody in the restaurant seemed to have ordered it.  And wow....  I believe it's one of the best pizza I ever tasted.  The dough was crisp and chewy, and thin.  The sauce and cheese was out of this world.  When you go to this place, order a pizza, and you won't be disappointed.  As for the water option, they give you option of sparkling water and just regular water.  Anyways...  Service was superb!!  Waiters were very friendly.  Oh...  The noise level was...  VERY LOUD!!!  Oh, on the side note, bathroom was nice too.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/MK2BXCaLSjPNvGP9rfpQNA/60s.jpg,5/1/2012,78,55,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Prilly M.,"One of the better restaurants in LA. Very chic for the area it's located in. Love the sweet bar. Cupcakes are delicious and very well presented. Macroons are a little more dense than what I would have liked. that may be due to the region of Europe where the owner or baker is from - they tasted like my grandmothers who was from French Belguim. Interesting flavors for the Macaroons. I still prefer Lette in Beverly Hills, but some were yummy and they were all very colorful and nicely presented.Presentation for Bottega Louie is at it's best. The food comes very well set and the desserts you buy come in cute little boxes. FOOD FAVS: Portobello Fries, Eggs Benedict, Shrimp Scampi, Flatbread BreakfastPARKING: Parking is behind the restaurant in a lot for $7. Paying that much for parking does not thrill me, especially when it's for the restaurant your eating in. The valet doesnt park your car- he directs you where to go. Plus, also be aware - walking from the lot to the front door of the restaurant (which is not far), you will be approached by at least 1 homeless person asking for money and they will sometimes follow you to the door. Although not a far walk, I wish it was more secure with security outside at least watching. Lord knows if your mugged the valet aint coming to your rescue","Burbank, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,4/27/2012,0,6,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Raquel A.,"Bottega Louie was overall was fantastic but a few things held me back from giving it 5 stars. To start, we had the portabello fries with aoili dipping sauce, this was amazing and different than anything I have had before. We then had a salad which was good but the cheese in it was still frozen, rendering some of them inedible.  Then, the pizza was a great although I think Pizza Mozza is better. Our waitress then pretended  to comp us macarons, even though others received macarons with their check, to make up for the frozen cheese in the salad.  Macarons are not something I would usually choose to eat-  I  am not a huge fan. She also said she gave us flavors that would sell out (which was not the case- there were hundreds there).  We did have the chocolate souffle, this is my desert of choice, which was delicious although a bit pricey.  Overall, it was a great it, could have done without the lying and the frozen cheese- she probably should have comped the salad.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,3/4/2012,0,13,

With 3000 reviews, there really isn't need for another, but I have to admit that after finally going here last week for dinner that it really is a great meal for the price. My friend and me shared a modena salad and a burrata pizza. The salad was marvelous. I loved the lettuce, nuts, and goat cheese with a perfect balsamic vinaigrette. For the pizza, I have to say it was good. Maybe not amazing. Just good. And good is good.The atmosphere is nice. The crowd was relaxed. Being downtown (except parking) is always fun these days.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Johanna C.,"Bottega louie is located in downtown los angeles and is a pretty famous and well-known restaurant. Before I arrived, I thought the restaurant would be small and crowded (like most downtown restaurants) but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the restaurant was very spacious with high, white ceilings. When you first enter the restaurant, you will see a case of goodies that will automatically make your mouth drool. we came for their brunch on a weekend so the wait was about 40 minutes so we decided to indulge ourselves in their macaroons while we waited for our table (efficiency at its best!). We tried a variety of macaroons: pistachio, espresso, earl grey, salted caramel, vanilla, lemon, and raspberry - all were very delicious and baked perfectly (I know how difficult this is!!) and my favorite were the pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla. For brunch, I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes which was served with house made blueberry syrup. It was very moist, soft, and delicious. My friend ordered the eggs benedict which was good however the portion was small. We sat next to the pizza oven so we had entertainment throughout our meal and got to watch the cooks toss pizza dough high into the area while we enjoyed our brunch. In fact, all the servers were all friendly and nice.","Minneapolis, MN",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/k-0A58apPhllPgpg-O6T_g/60s.jpg,11/16/2011,120,207,240
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Nick G.,"Loved this place! Coming from Seattle it reminded me of this organic breakfast/brunch shop we have called Portage Bay only it was a couple notches up. I really enjoyed their fresh fruit juices that they offer until 3pm along with the sophisticated breakfast options.I went with the Salmon Benedict (how can you not?) and my date went with the French Toast. For an appetizer we indulged in the Portabello fries. I didn't realize that the fries themselves were actually mushrooms... I just thought they were relished in them. Wasn't too much of a fan for that reason.Don't make too many foodie assumptions when ordering. I was expecting an english muffin w/ my benedict and it was made out of hash browns instead (I am not a fan of shredded potatoes for the most part). Guess I should have read the fine print eh?My girl enjoyed the french toast but had sudden impulses to go with the waffles instead although she enjoyed herself regardless.Overall I loved the bustle of the venue. The restaurant was cleanly, classy, and had a great vibe. The food was good and I definitely want to come back for more. I know it seems like I have a lot of gripes but I'm actually pretty optimistic about the place other than the slight surprises. Our waiter was awesome as well!After lunch I couldn't help but purchase some of their fabulous macroons. Unbeknownst unto me I would spend over $20 on those bad mamma jammas.I didn't expect to spend as much as I did but overall it hit me for around $120. I suppose it would be less if you exchanged the cocktails for coffee and the macaroons for something a little healthier :)Next on my hit list: Bottega Louie sausage pizza","Maple Valley, WA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/r1NsvojIIPbtdCYBVA_XHQ/60s.jpg,11/13/2011,248,158,15

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,J Allen B.,"Took my eight-year-old son out to an evening snack here to celebrate some school achievements, and they really made our nite out an exceptional one. Warm, engaging hostess and waiter, and even the bus staff was incredibly friendly. The atmosphere was lively but not too loud. Enjoyed the best sausage pizza I've had in years---fantastic crust with lots of character, crispy outside, chewy inside. Superb, fresh toppings and the homemade sausage was excellent. A nice caesar and sangiovese for dad rounded out the meal. Dessert was a rich chocolate soufflé with creme anglaise, which was full of dark cocoa-y goodness. Minds were blown. Looking forward to a full evening here sometime soon!","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Cb9Zzeey4w9nyXNxibIREw/60s.jpg,10/31/2011,2,1,

Freaking delicious touched (croutons on the salads).  I don't know how you make fresh ground pepper taste so good-  but they have managed that as well.   And if you are fortunate enough to visit while they have the chocolate souffle on the menu with creme anglais-  order it!You sit fishbowl style as the up and coming as well the downtrodden pass by.The restaurant reminds me of something transplanted from Tribecca, oddly happy with its new town and friends.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/17vTdr_F5kXfk-S2f3uEJA/60s.jpg,10/20/2011,12,52,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Milly M.,"I just love sitting here in this airy and light space.   The people are beautiful, the space is beautiful and the food... oh dear god!  It reminds me of a low-key Kate Mantelini without any of the Bev Hills industry riff-raff.  But the food.... the drinks... ! How can I manage to keep my composure while I write?!?  I think that the pastas are the strong point here (Trenne) as well as some beautifully measured salads and small plates.  Things change with the season, so I am glad it is autumn again so I can get the roasted squash soup. Technicolor maroons make starting a night, or coming off of one a pleasure!  They are a perfect party gift!  Weird and bright  The often cited s'mores bon bons.... I didn't want to believe, but it is true!  They are yum!This place is great for breakfast, great for lunch and great for dinner/ late night.  You can be ""dressed"" or look like you rolled out of your loft and you'll fit right in.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,John L.,"I thought I had better write this review before I forget all of the wonderful things that I like about this place. The crowd is diverse and the place appeals to everyone from tourists, to families, to couples, to businessmen/women, to gatherings with friends (the latter was why I came here).  It's cute and clean and the impressive array of desserts that you see upon arrival really sets the tone for what you are about to experience. The  we tried as much as we could get our little hands on. Here are my favorites: (i) The smoked salmon benedict on potato pancakes. Probably the best I've ever had! Genius really and not as heavy as the traditional eggs benedict with ham and english muffin. Price for most of the entrees were under $20. I thought prices were very reasonable with one caveat -- the $2 box that you pay for the macarons, which are already $1.75 each! Okay, I gave in and paid it because it was just too cute to resist and who knows when I will have the opportunity to come back. The service was very good. The wait and bus staff were all very friendly and unassuming. I like that.","North Hills, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/nL30O__zvo40AN1pL-1PFw/60s.jpg,10/19/2011,0,6,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Camille M.,"I went here with my godsister the other day and loved the feel of the place. It was a very clean and open space, decorated all white with dark furnishings, giving it a grandeur type look. I shared the Orecchiette pasta and split the pizza between pepperoni and mushroom. The pasta was okay, but the pizza was BOMB. I think it was the mozzarella cheese that definitely made the difference, eating other pizza with the usual cheese may not be something I want to go back to after eating the one from here. After lunch, we went over to the colorful bakery section that featured so many beautiful desserts and macarons in a variety of colors. Since this place is known for their macarons, I got only three because they are a bit expensive for some little things (1 for $1.75!); I tried the Rose, Vanilla, and Salted Caramel which were all good! I need to go back and get me more for sure. Overall I love the ambiance of the place, the only downside is that it's pretty loud in there, so you need to speak a lot louder for whoever you're with to hear you.","Baltimore, MD",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/lqA1yXRWDNHonhh0-kh3Vg/60s.jpg,10/13/2011,394,30,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jason C. J.,"Nestled within the vibrant city of Downtown Los Angeles, lies this place  called Bottega Louie. Known for its traditional Italian confections and desserts, not many people know that it is also a quality Italian Restaurant.When I first walked in, I thought I stepped into an air craft hangar since the place had a really high ceiling and it was really loud. I feel as if I had to shout so that my fellow food critic friend could hear me over the other people. I'm glad I am Asian because my voice pitch is pompous anyways. xD We waited a good 10~15 minutes to be seated since we came on a Friday night. My friend ordered the Penne Gamber while I went with the Clam Linguini. I must admit when the food came, I wanted to dig in right away. BUT before that, we took out our trusty cameras for YELP review proof. A glass of Pinot Grigio (white wine) with our food made our meal enjoyable and sort of romantic, wouldn't you agree? General tab here is about $20 per person excluding drinks for dinner.Service: Attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. I would definitely come back here if I am in the area again. Best to come here for dinner for two or for a party of 4.","San Francisco, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/nB_00FgTlOmCWprkXRaVug/60s.jpg,10/3/2011,1642,992,676

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Bob S.,"I didn't come here for the desert although I wished I had tried some, but when you're doing nothing but eating while visiting LA, sometimes a break from copious amounts of calories need to be portioned. And so I ordered a salad.It had chopped lettuce, garbanzo beans, tomatoes, black olives, pepperoncini, provolone, pepperoni, onions, cucumbers & red wine vinaigrette. It was a little too salty, a little heavy on the dressing, and the pepperonis were ineptly cut in my opinion but it was pretty darn fresh. My sis ordered the Modena which had butter lettuce, candied walnuts, crumbled goat cheese, shallots, fresh herbs & creamy balsamic vinaigrette. This was the better choice of the two and the goat cheese just did wonders for this plate. I was pleasantly surprised at the right proportions of salad given to us - not too much, not too little.I'll have to come back and try their pastries and other dishes to appreciate the fullness BL has to offer but for now I think a 4 star rating is suitable to the apt service.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/MFtkPg-yEsKHLyPYqbnQsA/60s.jpg,9/2/2011,0,5,

Just like most of the other reviews, the mushroom fries are a must, along with the pizzas, and desserts. There is definitely a wait unless you go early.

I've been here several times and I've tried different dishes each time. The food is mostly simple and fresh Italian cuisine, but I think the two things that have me revisiting are the Portobello Fries and the Macarons. The fries aren't super oily and heavy even though they're deep-fried, and I like the dipping sauce they come with. The macarons are just a nice treat to bring home after your meal. Though they're a little pricey, I definitely think they're worth it. They come wrapped in cute little boxes. :) I'd recommend coming early in the day if you want the best selection of macarons.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jessica T.,"I admit I am a lover of a great aesthetic.So I was waiting with great anticipation for this gorgeous restaurant to open. What was it going to be ?A beautiful marble wonderland with a slight architectural nod to the Romans ? Hmm... interesting.Ventured in here for a fun Friday night, sexy date in tow. A word to the wise, if you are not a lover of the loud, lively, what I consider fun eating establishment, this is not the place for you. The place was packed but we were seated quickly and graciously.I am a lover of almost all things bruscetta and Bottega's was good, not the best Ive ever had by far. VERY fresh ingredients which of course are great, but really didnt have enough garlic or flavor for me.Fried mozzarella was presented beautifully, as were all the apps. Seriously who knew an appetizer known to grace the microwaves and sports bars of America could look so pretty? Again, it was good, but maybe not exactly something to write home about.The basil, margarita pizza was delicious however. Warm, and fresh, bursting with flavor. Definitely worth a try and my fave thing of the night.Service was in my opinion close to impeccable even with the heavy traffic flow of the night. These servers obviously understand the importance of giving patrons an experience and not just a meal. ( extra star addded for the great service).Again, this is really not the place for a warm, cozy date. The acoustics dont lend themselves to that kind of atmosphere.","Orange County, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/xxefw7TDbVFRP2ZSi2y82Q/60s.jpg,11/20/2010,18,41,2
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,jenn s.,"Something about that giant sign in book scares me away each time and hearing the dreaded wait time. i've walked out twice unwilling to wait, but i still feel drawn to this place! I think it's those darn colorful macarons that call my name each time. Well, i'm not real up for eating neon colored macarons, but the pink one enticed me at $1.75. They even fooled me into buying four as a gift for 8 bucks! Atleast it came in a pretty box. I saved my macaron to eat work the next day and i have to say that it wasn't the perfect snack i was so looking forward to. It had a strong raspberry flavor within the chocolate filling, but it was all too sweet. TOO SWEET for me? yep! my friends enjoyed the lemon one. i've definitely had better macarons in my taste, for less $ and bigger size. 3 stars for their macarons.i upped one star for insurance.I still gotta cross their portabello fries off my list...","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/rOMe9AIfsAYUQBhsRdXfvw/60s.jpg,11/19/2010,9,34,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Tuan T.,"This place has some really good food. I come here at least once every 2 months, and each time it doesn't disappoint. There's usually a line (esp for brunch), but the wait is well worth it.The setup is nice, very casual yet a very chic at the same time. The high ceiling, marble floors and white on white decor is something else, some people may think its plain, but I think its very elegant.We ordered the penne, the lasgana, the club and the torpedo sandwhich. The pastas were great. and you can't go wrong with a club sanwhich. The torpedo was a bit bland, it tasted like something you could get from subway, but hey, it was my fault for ordering something so ordinary.There's plenty of parking in dtla, and if you need to, you can pay in the lot.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,anita l.,"ok so , im not a much of a yelper and im not much of a foodie, but after my second visit to this place i decided, maybe its something i should write about.so i came to bottega louie on a sunday night with my friend hannah. it was her birthday and she really wanted to eat there after hearing great things from coworkers. i had tried to talk her out of it because i had been in once before and just remember having to wait. for everything. but she really wanted to eat there and since she was the birthday girl i couldnt say no. so i resolved myself to a night of a 40min wait to flag down a waiterwhen we get there, hannah immediately goes crazy for the pastries, it is quite a beautiful display case, not to mention the workers in the funny little hats. i walk over to the host desk and give my name for our party of two and the host this really tall guy, very sweetly replies that it would be about 20 -30 min. yay.......we killed time people watching and the like had a drink at the bar. f.y.i the best margarita ive ever had.EVER!shortly after seating, our server came over, i dont remember her name but i do remember she had feathers in her hair, she walked right up smiled and addressed me by name even knew that it was hannahs birthday. scary but wonderful stuff.and the rest of the right was all downhill from there. i could tell that it was must have been busy whenever our  server wasnt at our table she was moving like lightening. but she still had time to talk to us about the menu, make recommendations the scampi,  buratta, trenne, all her suggestions all awesome! when she was at our table we felt like we were her only guests. even finishing the night with our dessert sporting a candle and hannahs name with happy birthday. needless to say perfect nitebut once again the only thing i could complain about was the noise, it is so hard to have a conversation in that place wouldve given it a 5 outta 5 but the ringing hasnt stopped so i held back. needless to say bottega thanks for a great night, i will be back but this time with ear muffs","Rosemead, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/QDANyAnTmi3O7b7XuFJDkA/60s.jpg,7/14/2010,0,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Sharon P.,"Been here twice already- once for lunch on a weekday, and once for dinner. Nice venue. Very, VERY large and white. Gets REAAALLLYY loud after awhile... But kind of adds to the experience. When we came here for lunch, it was mostly businessmen in power suits and frou frou ladies with high hair and a higher nose. It was very crowded, but there wasn't a wait.My friend I ordered the Bianco pizza, the shrimp gamberi(?) pasta, portabello fries, and calamari (yes yes, quite a big spread for just the 2 of us, but we wanted to try EVERYTHING). Now I love arugula on pizza so the bianco was great! Very garlicky and cheesy. Just hoped they had crispier crusts... The pasta was good. Basically shrimp scampi. Portions look kind of small, but with all the other food to try, I did't mind. The portabello fries were very good. Not what I had expected tho. Thought it'd be more seasoned and crispier, like real fries... Hahahaha. Calamari was just your standard fried rings and tentacles. I really liked the free bread they give out. I judge a lot of these restaurants on the quality of their bread because honestly, if I know you're not skimping out on the free stuff, I know my paid stuff's gonna be pretty darn good.The service was good but it DOES take awhile to flag someone down at times.My dinner experience was almost the same. But instead of the shrimp pasta, I got the trenne, which was kind of odd... They were like french fries. But it was still good. Got beers tho and their beers are pretty pricey. $6 for the domestic cheap beers...For dinner on weekends however, you have to go after 5 to order from the full menu, otherwise, you can only order from the limited salad and pizza menu...","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ECgbm02j2VOYDsAqVhXa1g/60s.jpg,4/8/2010,80,178,13

I like the transparent kitchen and the moldings. The walls are also white and pristine. I ordered mMargherita pizza. It was great and I love the crust.  It was crunchy and thin. I had also coconut macaroons. Portobello fries is also to dine for.What I don't really like is that the place is usually crowded during peak hours. The pizza also needed to be reheated though it was good. However, I'll still be back and will try their other dishes.","Glendale, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Lka3q49hMr7FcWhgo2zgHw/60s.jpg,3/25/2010,7,54,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Darin L.,"Bottega Louie has been extremely popular since it opened up almost a year ago, being called a 'Best New Resstaurant' in LA by numerous publications. I had been once when they first opened and thought it pretty good, though the service was poor. It was time to re-visit, for a Friday lunch.We were told by the server that the portobello fries are one of the most popular items on the menu, so we had to give them a try.Although I really don't like mushrooms too much, these were pretty good. The portobello was battered, fried, and tossed with herbs and parmesan cheese.Next up, we had the sausage pizza. The pizza was wonderful, and pretty authentic Neapolitan. It had a light, thin crust, a tangy and sweet tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and a delicious fennel sausage. The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little wet towards the middle of the pizza. Potentially the best pizza I had all week, and I had Mozza this week.Mussels and claims in a white wine broth was next. A very generous portion here, with some nice crusty bread to sop up the broth. The seafood was very fresh, and the broth was delicious as well.Then we had a 10-layered Lasagna with a lamb and veal bolognese. I like a lot of noodle in my lasagna, so when I heard ""10 layers,"" I was totally on it. However, this dish was just okay. There was probably just too much noodle, and not enough meat and cheese for me . Another generous portion.Although we were quite full, we weren't leaving without the souffle. It's a chocolate souffle, made-to-order, with a side of creme anglaise. To me, there aren't made dessert combinations better than chocolate-vanilla, and hot-cold. This is a really good souffle.I had a very pleasant experience at Bottega Louie, and could easily see why it's so popular. The first time I came, the service was rather mediocre. However, that was when they first opened, and they've really streamlined the process. While I think some of the dishes can be hit-or-miss, as there's just so many options on the menu, there are probably more 'hits' than 'misses.' I'd definitely just come back for the pizza.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/9uCOLB-Zb-mZFHHCnqpEZw/60s.jpg,2/26/2010,299,205,929
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Laura P.,"Bottega Louie: Downtown dining at its finest, without the Fine Dining price tag. When first stepping through Bottega Louie's gilded, glass doors, you might be forgiven for mistaking the place for Willy Wonka's factory - if Wonka had the design aesthetic of a Park Avenue princess. Rows of multicolored confections greet you from shining glass cases as soon as you enter; from red and purple macaroons to petite vanilla and red velvet cupcakes presented in golden holders, your mouth will already be watering, your eyes trying to take in the marbled splendor of the surroundings.Restaurant, bar and gourmet market blend seamlessly together thanks to the open-plan layout, lending the establishment a frenetic energy and - less appealingly - a sometimes deafening soundtrack. The kitchen is also on display through a glass partition, allowing guests to witness the culinary acrobatics and catch a whiff of the tantalizing scents that combine to create their meal. Wait times during peak hours can be nightmarish, with very little space at the bar available, but patrons looking for a late lunch or early dinner can usually find the place calm and quiet - perfect for a business meeting. If you're fortunate enough to snag a table, there are a number of tempting lunch and dinner options; a personal favorite is the Filet Mignon Arrabbiata, the steak seared to tender perfection in a juicy tomato sauce. Louie's pizzas are also a treat; loaded with toppings and undoubtedly filling enough for even the most insatiable appetite. If, however, the crowds seem too daunting for a lengthy stay, many of the restaurant's best dishes are available in the gourmet market section; from fresh Kobe sliders prepared right in front of you to a host of takeaway salad and pasta options, you're certain to find something to satisfy. And don't forget to grab one of those red velvet cupcakes on the way out.","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,2/16/2010,0,2,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Charo B.,"Here goes my first review on yelp. :)Living close to 7th and Grand in downtown LA, I have driven by this restaurant numerous times. Finally, during my lunch break from work, my boyfriend and i decided to check this place out. I couldn't sit and dine in because i was already running late. the Restaurant is divided into two section: the restaurant and a section where you take-out pre-made food. they have a variety of selection from lasagnas to chicken breasts, they also have sides like potato salads..... i think it was the prime rib sliders but they are $2 and delicious. also, their mini fruit tarts are the best tarts i've ever put in my mouth. it was incredibly scrumptious and i enjoyed every single bite. a month later, my gf and i decided to stop by bottega louie for some desserts and we ended up feasting.We shared the:1) the server recommended the ravioli for starters (House made pasta stuffed with spinach and ricotta in a light cream sauce with pancetta, sage & peas), i've had my share of good ravioli and it was okay. it was extremely light but i don't think i'll ever order it again.  2) portobello fries comes with aioli. it starts off delicious but ends up being really oily. 3)  the branzino (Imported sautéed boneless Italian sea bass,micro herbs & scarpa sauce) for our main dish. the presentation was nice. it was bland and a little fishy. i've had better branzino.overall, i love the vibe of the restaurant. it's so spacious and the high-ceiling gives it more of a majestic feel. the gold trimming outside of the building and the large wall windows allows you to people watch and enjoy the sun. Finally we have a cool, hip restaurant in LA. :) BTW, the service is spectacular!","Los Angeles, CA",4.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/kRZGvMuVdfQn9B5ePvrgSg/60s.jpg,7/7/2009,446,37,28
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Nina O.,"I had been waiting for the perfect time to write my first Yelp......and like someone in a love affair I have thought AND talked about Bottega Louie all day since eating there last night.The service was welcoming, prompt, friendly, genuine...etc. etc. we thorougly enjoyed interacting with the staff!!  our water glasses were always refilled, timing was precise, and we were re-marked with silverware to the T.  Small plates and affordable, yet versatile, menu choices made it easy to share. The food was light and delicious, but my friend and I (the amazing elite yelper below me!!) decided that the apple torte dessert was the best part. The only drawback were the rosemary potatoes which were a little on the dry side.Complemented with a sophisticated sleekness and New York lofty feel, the ambience is A1. (how i met your mother fans ;) Everything from the walls to the bathroom is a pristine white.However, I will warn yelpers, the restaurant space is definitely an ""all eyes on you"" place, so be careful not to trip when making a bathroom trip.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Isaac V.,"Overall, a relaxed and good lunch. I would expect to wait for around 30 minutes to be seated because it is reasonably priced and, depending on the day and hour, may get extremely busy...But as a pastry fun, we had all the pastries, and while they are all excellent, the caramel one is really outstanding.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Gregory F.,"Being half Italian I feel I can spot a great Italian meal right when I taste it so after stopping in for Valentines dinner tonight I can say that this is delicious food and nothing like so many of the non authentic Italian restaurant chains all around the US. They have a great selection of desserts and many will be stopping in for those, but the restaurant service is the real best part. They don't take reservations, nor can you put your name on a waitlist digitally like they say they can do on their VM, but still we only waited 25 minutes tonight and it was worth it.I had to get an Italian Soda to drink with my meal because they have been something that I have loved since childhood but rarely see anymore, so if you're in the mood for something sweet I would highly recommend ordering one.  For the food we ordered the Carpaccio to start and it was very good and for $18 it was a fair price.  For our entrees we got the Carbonara (which was my favorite) and the Burrata pizza.  I can say the pizza is the best that I've had in DTLA, Pizzanista is my other favorite, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was.It had crisped garlic on top and they went above by cooking the spinach before adding it to the pizza which is the authentic way and sadly many other places don't focus on the smaller details as well.Overall a casual and delicious meal. It's priced fairly and can get very busy depending on the day and time so I would be prepared to wait around a half an hour to be seated. I will be back again soon.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/UZBsJJWBCv3tRwYUP_TcgQ/60s.jpg,7/28/2022,31,14,5

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Terry D.,"This is my go-to about three to four times a week since I moved into a loft directly upstairs. Not only is the space beautiful, but the food is uniformly delicious, prepared and served with perfection.Half the time, I sit at the bar to grab a solo dinner. This is where Sonia, Sarah, Stephen, and Gavin take very good care of me. My fave solo meals are the Cacio e Pepe or the meatballs with a side of brussels sprouts or the burger, one of the best in LA.I also have frequent business lunches or dinners here. On those occasions, I always ask for Mariana's station, because she's the best--super friendly, fun and attentive. For these meals, I suggest the Calabrese pizza, the trenne pasta (crunchy pasta with short rib sauce), the carbonara pasta. And if you want a salad, the Louie is awesome!Oh, and the bakery is insane if you like beignets and chocolate chip cookies. I'm a lucky man to live above this excellent eatery.","Century City, Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/nHI7JX6aniZ0HipmE-L8iQ/60s.jpg,5/22/2022,69,68,2
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Kathrine M.,"BEST WAY TO GET YOUR EX LOVER BACK REUNITE TOGETHER CONTACT LORD ZULU DIRECTLY ON WHATSAPP +19097814612How to get your ex back fast! I was hurt and heart broken when a very big problem occurred in my marriage seven months ago, between me and my husband . so terrible that he took the case to court for a divorce. he said that he never wanted to stay with me again, and that he didn't love me anymore. So he packed out of the house and made me and my children pass through severe pain. I tried all my possible means to get him back, after much begging, but all to no avail. and he confirmed that he had made his decision, and he never wanted to see me again. So one evening, as I was coming back from work, I met an old friend of mine who asked my husband .So I explained everything to him, so he told me that the only way I can get my husband back is to visit a priest, because it has really worked for him too. So I never believed in spells, but I had no other choice, than to follow his advice. Then he gave me the Email address of the priest whom he visited.  So the next morning, I sent a letter to the address he gave to me, and the priest assured me that I will get my husband back the next day. What an amazing statement!! I never believed, so he spoke with me, and told me everything that I needed to do. Then the next morning, So surprisingly, my husband who didn't call me for the past 7 months, gave me a call to inform me that he was coming back. So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day, with lots of love and joy, and he apologized for his mistake, and for the pain he caused me and my children. Then from that day, our relationship was now stronger than how it was before, by the help of a priest. So, I will advise you out there if you have any problem contact LORD ZULU, I give you 100% guarantee that he will help you.. or WhatsApp him on +1(909)7814612 call:  +   1(213) 538-2469EMAIL: WEBSITE; ","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,5/17/2022,0,2,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Varam M.,I always would always come to Bottega Louie Pre Covid. I have to say it's one of the most nicest restaurants someone can walk into. Bottega never lets me down with their food or their service. Food is amazing and their brick oven pizzas is one of the best on the menu. You can see the open kitchen where the chefs prepare your food. Very fancy place to come with a friend group or family. Hands down they have the best deserts compared to other restaurants. Their macaroons are designed so nicely with a fancy box to go with it. The atmosphere is loud but i'm fine with that. They also have two sides to the restaurant. The cafe is towards the door and the restaurant seating is more towards the back. Their high ceiling almost makes you feel like your in a castle ahh. I love their organization skills and how they work everything out real quick. Most fantastic Italian restaurant out there!,"Vineyard, Glendale, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/4vOvTPzwwJcKqxnHkeFWSg/60s.jpg,12/23/2020,48,52,13

Even the manager kept coming to our table and even though she didn't have to, she kept apologizing to us for having such issue which we appreciate and let us know how amazing they are.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jessica K.,"While this review specifically pertains only to the macarons, I feel obligated to say something because of how fantastic they were. I tried the salted caramel, raspberry, and birthday cake macarons. While the birthday cake macaron wasn't anything too special, the salted caramel and raspberry were absolutely phenomenal. All the ""melt in your mouth"" ""perfect balance of sweet and creamy"" stuff you hear. Yeah. It's all true. The consistency of the cookies are wonderful and the raspberry definitely ranks the highest of all macarons I've had.  I'll definitely be back for the macarons.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jessica D.,"Where else can you go downtown to buy a little bit of heaven? There are over 20 flavors of deliciously delightful macaroons at $2.50 a piece which come with a beautiful decorated box that holds five. But which five did I choose? I love the mint, espresso, raspberry, and bananas Foster,  vanilla seems a little bland probably because I ate the Bolder flavors first. It wasn't the first time I purchased them so I'm guilty of choosing them more than once. Anyways it's in downtown LA and it's one place where you can purchase beautiful treats and desserts like cakes and beignets. The staff is attentive and kind  enough to package my purchase in a gorgeous box that was beautiful.","San Diego, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/F1np3TROx1O6XX70ZJBM1A/60s.jpg,5/23/2018,8,9,3

The Pizza's are amazing, the service is always great. We have been to Bottega about 8-9 times now and every time it just gets better. I must say that the acoustics in the space are not that great, it is super load in the restaurant, I suppose that comes with the territory for a beautifully restored older downtown building. I feel like I am in Europe every time I am there. I suspect the parking may be a bit tight as it is prime downtown, we always Lyft to keep from dealing with parking.

We mixed the salad and it was delicious! The Portobello fries were tasty, but the aioli sauce made the appetizer worth it! Even though it's a bit touristy, this is still a place you must try.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Kevin I.,"This review is only based on Bottega Louie's coffee, service and ambiance because I did not have a meal there. I promise to update it when I go back and try their food - because I definitely want to go back!The place is so beautiful and elegant. I took a prospect (now client) there for coffee and he was super impressed. I'm sure that having taken him there helped close the deal!!It's a great place for a business coffee or meal, but I also have a feeling that their drinks and food are good based on the young, hip crowd that started packing the place as it got closer to lunch time.I'm looking forward to returning!","San Luis Obispo, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/XwPqjKytABKq-4oXV4GTYA/60s.jpg,9/6/2016,16,9,

My girlfriend ordered the french toast, which was also made perfectly - soft with great taste!Attention to detail! The servers took down my last name, and then walked up to me after 10 minutes, even though there was several people waiting, they remembered who I was. We also used their free wi-fi, and received an email thanking us for our visit. I've never been to a restaurant that was so exceptional at little things.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Pedro A.,"I've been here about a handful of times to just to be sure I was in love with this place. And I still am. :)The decor here is simple, white, and bright! It is very spacious. When you walk in, you will see the dessert section. Your eyes does not fool you, it was a heaven for those with a sweet tooth. My favorite- the peanut butter terraine. They also have macarons for those who prefer something on the go. If you want, you can also have them save you the dessert you like after you've finished your meal.Brunch, dinner, PIZZA- all amazing. I kid you not. I will say the #1 reason why Bottega loses its stars is mainly because of the wait, but come on, this is always a happening spot, and ppl either come early or make reservations in advanced. Despite the wait, their food here is always consistent. And the e customer service is always on spot.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Barry A.,"I bought my bed from Ken last year. After price comparing at Sit n Sleep, Mattress Store etc. I learned that I could not get into a Simmons for less than $800 with the exception of  Ken. He did his magic and made it happen. Yay! Being on a beer budget I could not be happier. Recently I went back to Ken to order the Steel bed frame with slats. Home Depot offers the Queen size for $150. Ken offered me his unit that has twice the strength, weight, and steel as HD's model. Since it was  a floor model, Ken's wife knocked the price down from to $300 to $100 . I was so elated. I sent a few of my friends there too. They all gave me 'hi five's' ! ","Santa Monica, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/-QXGUjc7t9EgXg01Vv8CBw/60s.jpg,11/24/2015,29,3,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Gene H.,"I highly recommend CPHAC as I found the staff competent and highly qualified. The experience started with Little Jose who came to inspect and repair my parents furnace. He said he could repair the bad ignition control but due to the age of the furnace and safety concerns he suggested speaking with Doug, System Advisor. Doug came out the next day and left a proposal for us to consider. Very professional and didn't use any pressure to close the deal. After he left I compared pricing with competitors and although CPHAC was not the cheapest I felt confident that they would provide the best service partly because they have been in business since 1963 and I couldn't find any disqualifying reviews. Noel and Jerry came out in a couple of days to install the Carrier furnace within the estimated time frame. They prepped the area where the furnace was to be installed and when finished left their work area spotless.  Supervisor Ross followed up to make sure that we were happy with their service. The answer was yes!","West Hills, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ZSYrpjploG6yeVhFJiJ1Cg/60s.jpg,11/24/2015,0,4,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Nicole K.,"This place is reliably good. My favorite is the Louis salad with shrimp and the maichon chicken salad which had a citrus dressing. They recently added a Niçoise salad to the menu which was a typical Niçoise salad but a really great typical Niçoise salad. As you can tell I really like salad but the burger is amazing too. I have probably tried every pizza they have but my favorite is the burrata. Pizza is huge so keep that in mind. The burrata small plate is really creamy and delicious. I'm not a fan of the portabella fries because I don't like fried food and I don't like mayonnaise sauces but everyone else liked them. The crab cakes are great for crab cakes but I like the other stuff more. Meatballs were also great for meat balls. Brunch is also good here .

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Peter I.,"Bottega Louie is opening April 6, and a couple of my co-workers and I went for the sneak peek lunch yesterday.  The food was awesome.  We wanted to give the menu a workout, so we ordered the pizza, ravioli, chicken parmigiana, and ribeye steak to share along with some asparagus and green beans on the side.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The pizza crust was thin and toasty with good flavor and the sausage on the pizza was excellent.  The ravioli was flavorful with spinach and ricotta cheese.  Chicken parmigiana is not my favorite, but this was flavorful and balanced.  The ribeye was great, very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Joe, our warm and smiling waiter, suggested that we get a chocolate souffle for the table., even though it required a 25 minute wait.  It was worth the wait. It was ""molto cioccolato"" or very rich with strong dark chocolate flavor.  We had a cup of coffee while we were waiting for the souffle, and the coffee was almost like dessert, it was strong with great coffee flavor.  We thought the prices were fair, a lot of dishes are $14.95, but it is an a la carte menu, so the prices can add up.  What we most loved, though, were the friendly and gracious management and staff.  They made our dining experience special.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TYqPXeVcctFG-IJiMjwiwQ/60s.jpg,10/24/2015,0,3,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Andre M.,"We went here for a breakfast, but the most memorable (and delicious) part of the experience was the time we spent ogling and perusing the beautiful dessert counters and then devouring the ones we picked. Filled with artistic and elegant tarts, mini-cakes, bars, macaroons and even beignets, there is something for every type of sweet tooth. These exquisite treats are a delight for the eyes and your stomach. The coffee was amazing as well.The food /desserts are a bit pricey and portions run on the small size. The atmosphere feels Italian with its posh marble interior and open floor plan which is awesome because they can accommodate large parties and you can see the chefs at work, but it also can get every loud and hard to hear the person next to you. As this place is popular, there may be a bit of wait. Despite all this it is truly worth the trip in for the unforgettable sweets. The desserts also hold really well in taste and stature if you get them to go - we ended up getting a few to take home as some looked too tasty and beautiful to leave there!","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,8/16/2015,43,18,16

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,M R.,On Sat June 20 my wife and I went to Advantage Ford in the city of Duarte off the 210 frwy. We spoke to Jorge a sales rep about a new veh. Jorge was patient with us as we drove three different cars on a hot day. With no pressure we sat down and got pricing for the vehicles. On Mon the 22nd we returned and drove another car and made a purchase. Rick the sales mgr was upfront with all the numbers. Joseph in financing explained all of our options clearly. Throughout the process we were never pressured and everyone was very professional. Thank you to our neighbor Michael who works in the service dept for leading us to Advantage Ford. This was our first time at this dealer and recommend them if looking for a car.,"Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,6/23/2015,0,7,2

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Sophie M.,"I can definitely see myself here with a couple of girlfriends, sipping on some cocktails, chatting up a storm, and having some of the best desserts you could imagine. They have a great food menu, too, but food and cocktails are a bit on the pricey side, so if you are in a rush and not looking to spend a ton of money, just stop in for desserts. You will be just as HAPPY, I guarantee it!I had lunch here and took my desserts to go because I had to head out to the airport. I had the Louie salad which had Iceberg lettuce, jumbo shrimp, hearts of palm, avocado, sweet onions, roma tomatoes, bell peppers, cracked pepper & dijon vinaigrette.  I also had an order of the Parmesan portobello fries because it came highly recommended. The salad was very good except I am not a huge  fan of iceberg lettuce because it contains little nutritional value however it was very well made and the hearts of Palm was my favorite part. The Portobello fries were good but a little bit too rich for my liking and it is more of an order for two, but I HAD to try it. I'm actually going to look up a recipe to try and make a baked version of  this at home.","Irvine, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/BX3ZE8iX4Bqt-ms_hr4gcg/60s.jpg,5/11/2015,0,3,

I'll definitely will go back to this place. The service was fast and really great. We couldn't decide at fist what we are going to eat but the waitress helped us decide.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Karen H.,"The VERY BEST EXPERIENCE IN CAR BUYING ever!!!!Those stars were earned by Matthew Aharoni, internet salesman and Greg Miller, finance.  I am a bit over the hill, so I have purchased my share of new cars and I always dread the experience, but through the professionalism and non-pressure assistance of these two men, when I purchased my new Hyundai elantra I was SO happy when I left there and SO relaxed!  I also want to tell you that the three hour drive from Santa Maria was oh, so worth it!  They bent over backwards to make my car buying experience as exciting and satisfying as it should be.  On top of all that, I love my new Hyundai!  I went from a being a Ford lady to my wonderful solid new car.  I say ""solid"" because those doors close nice and heavy like a big car would (BMW I owned) and wow, talk about gas mileage!  When I left there I got 54 mpg, which I haven't seen again, but I get about 49 on trips and about 34 to 32 in town.  It's heaven!  Now, if you are like me and your credit isn't stellar, then things might be ""iffy"" for you, but you know that going in, like I did, when I walked in.  People with credit messes might get higher percentages on their loans, but that shouldn't reflect on the buying experience at all, which for me it doesn't.  Matthew and Greg did their best for me and I am  so grateful for all their help.  If it can be done, Greg will get it done...   I LOVE my new Hyundai like I never thought I would!  It rides well, solid and true.  I can go 65 without even knowing it.  No whistles, no wobbles....just a solid ride.   The only caveat I have is that you might want to upgrade the radio speakers if you are a real music fan.  I am okay, but they probably need an upgrade.  I got the no frills car, BUT even then I got a back up camera!  Can you believe it?  I didn't want it, but now I love it!  :)   So if you need a new car, go see Matthew and Greg. They are two wonderful professionals who will help you leave there with a beautiful brand new car and feel very relaxed and happy!  You won't spend your whole Saturday at a car dealership in misery, I guarantee that!  Tell them Karen sent you, they'll know who you are talking about!","West Hills, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,4/29/2015,0,15,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Joyce R.,"Rosti Tuscan Kitchen in Santa Monica is our weekly ""date night"" destiny!  It's been a favorite of ours for many years.  The menu is large and the food is consistently of high quality, well-prepared and just plain YUMMY!  The facility is Tuscan-style open and pleasant - reminiscent of our travels to Italy.  The roasted chicken with two sides is a real pleaser.  Their signature pizzas are a local favorite, which I've had many times, and always notice other diners ordering them as well.  They have a thin crust with a delicious red sauce and several choices of toppings.  Rigatoni with sweet sausage and peppers made our cooking-Italian cousin swoon with delight the first time she tasted it.  There are other choices, too, like salads and panninis.  The prices are within reason and the service is always a delight, which brings me to give a shout-out to Chris, Jeremy, Salvatore, Myra, Anthony, Inga and Morgan!","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,4/9/2015,0,2,

This place pays attention to detail. For example when 2 friends and I ordered a pizza, they sliced the pizza in slices of 6 to make sure there was no awkward battle for the last slice. It is as clean as can be.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Wayne R.,"I have been searching for a decent Australian-Style Chicken Parmigiana in DTLA for the last 8 years, and have finally found one. It goes by the name Chicken Parmesan at Bottega Louie. I had it with their fries, which as any Aussie knows, is the perfect side for a parma. They even burned the edges of the crumbed fillet to make it exactly as it should be. Nothing better than crispy edges.The eclairs on the way out weren't too bad either.Thank you so much for a great meal!","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/iXkA6fXu-DzLqB9gOo5lYQ/60s.jpg,1/12/2015,1,9,1

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Reginald M.,"I brought some friends here yesterday and we all became fans. The restaurant looks very good and the service is just amazing. My chicken milanese was above average but my red velvet cupcake was amazing. All my friends seemed to like what they ordered. I was taken aback at 1st because I got used to the fact that when I ordered something, starch usually comes with it like mashed or roasted potato, etc; so when we got our food, we all looked at each other wondering where the sides were since all we got was only our chicken. I guess I should have read the menu closer because it said nothing that the entrees came with anything. I'm giving them 5 stars because the service more than made up for my above average chicken. I didn't try anything from the bar but my friend did and he said he said their white russian is on point and he's the type of guy that would throw his drink back to the bartender if it wasn't good enough.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/AsEu7h8bG9GiQwCCPe467g/60s.jpg,12/13/2014,2,9,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Monica F.,"Wow! I cannot even begin to explain how absolutely amazing this restaurant is. I visited here for the first time about 3 weeks ago. When I walked in, I had no idea I was about to walk into my new favorite restaurant! Everything about this place; the decor, the food, the service, and the atmosphere was fantastic! I was here with my boyfriend on a saturday night and we ended up having a great time. We've eaten at many restraurants, we eat out a lot, and usually our standards are high. We walked in and obviously had to wait about 45 minutes, just a heads up, even though I am sure others have mentioned the long waits. But I have to say, it was totally worth it. We were seated by a sweet hostess and greeted almost immediately by our server, Tony, who was very helpful with recommendations from the menu. We ordered a couple of appetizers which included their burrata and roasted vine tomatoes, arugala salad, and their incredible tomato soup. Next, we ordered a pizza (when you get there you'll see it's a must!) and the sea bass. Both were wonderful plates with amazing flavors. And of course, for dessert, we HAD to order the souffle. It is by far the best souffle I have ever had in my life. On top of all of that food, we couldn't resist and had to take a few macaroons home along with their raspberry beignets. They just melt in your mouth. Needless to say, I am coming back for sure!!!","Huntington Beach, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/tm_8fwUFhaB2tVttsIOGAg/60s.jpg,12/3/2014,17,4,4

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Yolanda L.,"We had been to the Bistro de la Gare and it was okay.  We decided to try it again, and to our pleasant surprise it is under a new ownership, Chef Bruno Morin.  What a difference!  We were seated promptly when we walked in, an immediate difference from the old owners.  The Server was friendly, knew the menu, and again prompt.  She asked what type of water we wanted and when we said just plain, she brought it in a lovely bottle with mint in it, so we could refill it ourselves.  I know you might not think it was a big deal, but it just showed the care they take with their customers.  I had Mussels-to die for!  They were so delicious they have spoiled it for other restaurants.  My husband had Beef Bourguignon which thought was very tasty.  We started with a Kir Royal, made to perfection.  The Bistro de la Gare is quaint, has lots of windows, and seating outside.  Please give it a try. Chef Bruno Morin is a very friendly man, who visits his guests and makes them feel welcome.  It is in South Pasadena, right near a stop on the gold line, which is a very short block away.","VALLEY VILLAGE, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/lU4YRRONmGti_KNssC0B9A/60s.jpg,11/16/2014,0,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Diana P.,"LOVE bottega louie! Not because it is the trendy posh place to be but because of the quality and the service.  Bloody Mary's and Mimosas were flowing for our Saturday Brunch...Portabella Fries...read about them and had no idea they were actually Portabella Mushroom fried! I thought they would be french fries in mushroom flavor? Amazing.  We ordered salmon eggs benedict and lots of sides of bacon.  Also...ordered macaroons for the table and still had to order more later for takeout at the bakery!  $340 brunch for 3 people but amazing experience.  Server was friendly and he got $100 of that amount!Forgot to check in when we went the first time. Was in la and craving th is place. Went with 2 friends.  One ordered the steak and eggs $25, one the salmon benedict (you can't go wrong ) and i had the lobster hash with eggs.  Server said 2nd best seller.  Of course we started with portabello fries...r he green creme fraiche they give is awesome.  Again, 5 star service, amazing quality food and just overall the best brunch spot in DTLA.  Mimosas and bloody Mary's flowed again.  We got there at 11 and there was no wait...we left at 1 and there was a long line.

The chef definitely put lots of thought into the levels of flavor.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Jbt6ZO1nYUmW_4x5vaNw4A/60s.jpg,8/12/2014,0,6,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Fahima A.,"Had a perfect time to kick off summer at brunch here with three of my LA girlfriends and delicious food. Very elegant decor all throughout the bakery and restaurant. Very good looking waiter. Delicious Bloody Mary!Next visit will be all about the macaroons! And pictures!! How could I forget to take pics especially when everything in here looks light, bright, crisp, and picture perfect.One of my favorite places!!!! I love their breakfast, pizza's, caprese salad, etc.! I especially love the macaroons!!!! I used to work less than a block from Bottega so I would go there at least once a week...sometimes twice a week. :)I just had dinner there couple of weeks ago with my husband for our 2 year anniversary!!! Can't wait to go back again soon.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/4JBjRV-4vI8dPlNXaAN7Dw/60s.jpg,8/11/2014,78,15,10

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jocelyn C.,WOW! Bottega Louie never fails to satisfy me. Their food is awesome and the macaroons are to die for! The atmosphere is great but it can get pretty noisy sometimes. The only downside I can think of would be the long wait but it is definitely an experience! Our server Allan was thoughtful and awesome as well! He was knowledgeable about the menu and his recommendations were spot on.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jumong S.,"The ambiance may be pompous at first impression, but the setting is perfect, the ceiling is high, and I can ""rest"" forever in their impressive restrooms.  Although we've had dinner & lunch here a couple of times on separate occasions, we specially love our Monday morning breakfast at our favorite tiny table in that same corner near the bar.  The service is attentive, cheerful and friendly.  The croissants are like ""pillows of heaven"", the ham & cheese croissant is something to look forward to having every morning.  My coffee fix is satisfied with the aroma alone of their Guatemalan coffee alone and get my refills to my hearts delight.   The turkey bacon tasted like the real thing and one order (3 slices) makes me a happy camper and transforms  me to a morning person which  I am not. The raspberry beignets are a soft sugary delight.   And the calamari - oh the calamari, enough said.  Mondays thru Fridays,  you are restricted to the breakfast menu, but weekend brunches one could order the Portobello mushrooms and their great thin crust pizza that I have customized with prosciuttos.   The place can get crazy some morning and definitely during lunch and dinner, but hey, who cares, I'm enjoying my food so sublime, the crowd can make all the noise they want.  Our favorite server, Eric of course and helping on the side is Cesar.  They treat us like VIPs or at least that's how they made us feel.  Wonderful people.  Great ambiance.  Delectable food.  Perfect recipe for success!  Bottega Louie, my favorite restaurant in downtown LA!  Don't forget your photo-op with the French macaroons in the background.  It is part of the ritual!","West Covina, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/NmmsESoOygylfwDAoXvl_g/60s.jpg,5/25/2014,0,8,

Waiter service attentive and friendly.  Food fantastic - While it was noisy, it still was easy to hear at our table of 7.  I had the portobella fries and eggplant parmigiana.  Only problem, and I attribute this to yelp, and not the restaurant, is that valet parking does not begin until after 7pm and is on 7th street. That would have been really helpful to know.  we will be back.","South Pasadena, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Cfwd9CQWgze5lCaPf9xt8g/60s.jpg,5/4/2014,0,4,

The pasta was a little al dente which complemented the incredibly tender meat perfectly. By the way, if you like Macarons, there is no better place in LA (maybe the world!) that has better macarons. Look: The look of this place was beautiful in my opinion. The ceilings were high and the marble was white. Overall, this restaurant has become my new favorite right alongside Katsuya and Kushiyu.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,1/7/2014,0,4,

We then had steak for the main course and followed that up with some eclares (sp) for desert. What many don't appreciate about this place is its location. It is located in the heart of DTLA. Within walking distance you can find museums, other bars, theaters, parks, malls, and LA Live. It is the best place to stop by and catch a bite after spending a day in downtown. Love Bottega.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Foodie X.,"I've eaten here 3 times in the past year, probably 7 times in the past three, and every single time they knocked it out of the park!!!The most recent experience was a week ago, for dinner.  Started out with a great cocktail at the bar (it was a variation of an Old Fashioned, but I'd still take their Manhattan any day) then went to a table.  We had a slightly larger party, some of whom were more casual diners (not the pretentious foodies me and my partner have become), and the server did a FANTASTIC job both letting us flaunt our own knowledge and also providing some direction of his own.  He was one of the most well balanced servers I've had in Los Angeles when it comes to both being present and also staying out of the way.Of course the food was all fantastic.  Everyone knows the Porcini Fries are a must; I also recommend starting with a pizza.  My absolute favorite of the night was the Duck Prosciutto Bruschetta, but it is so rich I thankfully had people to share it with or else I may have died from the luxury of it!  My friends enjoyed their pastas very much, and we made a meal of small & medium plates to share.We actually did NOT try my favorite dessert this time (Butterscotch Budino; one of my top 5 in LA along with Westside Tavern's Toffee Cake; Red Medicine's Coconut Bavarois; Milk's Oreo Cookies; & a soft spot in my heart for El Coyote's Fried Ice Cream) but we did an assortment of very good macaroons and tiramisu.  Not the GREATEST, but satisfying and a nice cap to a large meal.All told with no alcohol on the main check our bill was right around $300 for 6 people, and I feel like we were all BEYOND satisfied!  Can't wait to go back for a special date night though & drop that amount on just us =)","Beverly Hills, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/HO3J-Leso7Vf1cBaETjywQ/60s.jpg,11/19/2013,0,4,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jennifer C.,"Bottega Louie is by far my FAVORITE PLACE downtown Los Angeles! Every time I walk by it's beautiful, large window front and see the intricate, colorful desserts displayed, it reminds me of New York or Europe. Beyond the clean, white ceilings trimmed in spotless gold, Bottega offers a delicious menu of Euro-Fusion cuisine for the lighter fare and the hungrier ones. The small plates are a wonderful treat to share with several people. I have had dinner there several times after the L.A. Opera, but my favorite thing to do is go there on a weekday afternoon with a friend for scrumptious macaroons and lattes!","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/kpy_8Orzt661IWuyvh-5_A/60s.jpg,8/26/2013,123,24,28

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Liz O.,"There are over 4,000 reviews for this place, so just a simple review here.Things you MUST try here:(1) Portobello fries. (2) Any of the pizzas, especially Burrata & Bianco. In fact, you can ask for a pizza that is half & half. THIS is probably the best tip here! (3) The pastas are also very good. I especially liked the pan sauteed Trenne. (4) Salted caramel macarons on the way out. Chocolate chip cookies are another great option.Evenings & Weekends can get crowded. The front half of the restaurant on the bakery side is first come, first serve. And you get the full menu there as well. Use your eagle eyes and scout for a table.I'd give it 4.5 stars. Since I can't do 1/2 stars here, I was leaning more towards 4 than 5, but there's really nothing that I'd change about this restaurant. So 5 it is.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,5/16/2013,0,4,

Its the only thing of any substance close by that's not a bro bar, snob bar or mediocre businessman lunch place (the kind of place that can stay open forever being mediocre).Desserts? Superb.Pizza? Too good.Pasta? Why would you get pasta when you eat out? (but its good, too).Avoid the traps of downtown and eat here!","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/RlZc5y1hCFO8XcQKV7VgWg/60s.jpg,1/31/2013,8,1,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Kristen O.,"Not sure why this is only a 4 currently: everything they do they do well. Especially at the counter where you can get macaroons and possibly other things.Its a great experience no matter what you order, but I advice you don't ask how something is made or what special culinary pan or pot or spoon or whatever they use to make something since they all know WAY too much.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/R610RuNlSNE3mRy7Mh8zCw/60s.jpg,1/30/2013,15,3,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,John R.,"After reading all the great reviews and having my friends tell me how good of a place this is and that I must go and try it soo I did finally and wow amd I glad I did. The people that were working there were all friendly and very very busy. I have never seen any restaurant in the world have as many people inside as they did. Well, the reason they have so much people inside is because their food is bombbb! They god the best of everything. They have pasta, steak that I tried and I can admit it was the best pasta next to my moms. The service was fast and friendly since I mentioned there was a lot of people at the restaurant does not mean that they were not prepared for it. They have plenty of staff to handle every ones orders and not mess up.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Kimberly S.,"Entering the space, I walked through the bakery, take-out portion of the huge space. Immediately I felt the weight of the spectacular downtown lofty ceilings. I was accosted by the wafting smells of pizza set against the classic, yet modern incarnation of the brick pizza ovens (in this case white brick). This is the kind of place you would like to call yourself a regular for brunch with the sunday times. Dinner was good, certain dishes verged on great and the experience was excellent for the price.First the musts- the portabello fries. If you order one thing, make sure you don't miss out on these scrumptious, well seasoned, though still healthy (c'mon let me pretend, they are mushrooms after all!) small plate. The regular old potato fries were excellent as well, coated with perfect dusting of salt and crunch. The pizza, eggplant parm, branzino and beet salad where also quite good.The chicken hero and calamari small plate were below average.We enjoyed the assortment of macarons for dessert- my favorites are espresso and chocolate caramel, but all were good depending on your preference.All in all good, service, nice atmosphere, appropriate but not overwhelming number of downtown hipsters and good food with a few occasional misses.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Janie W.,"While I haven't given up on my mission to try each pizza that Bottega Louie offers (as of right now I'm 3 for 8) I've also added on the very important mission to try each and every macaron they offer...After having dinner at Perch with a girlfriend, we decided to stop by Bottega and have some macarons. Of course I was aware of the hype about macarons, attributing it as the next big ""it"" dessert following the popularity of cupcakes. Everyone I knew was ranting and raving about it and posting pictures of these round colorful discs all over Facebook.  I quickly dismissed them as an average sweet treat linking them to icky store-bought creme filled rectangular wafers. How ignorant I was (smh). When you enter Bottega, their bakery section entices you with all sorts of yummy looking desserts and pastries, but the macaron display will definitely catch your attention with its organized rows of colorful discs begging for you to look, touch, and finally taste. My friend, who has had Bottega's macarons before (and loves them), easily ordered 8. Me, aka the newbie, only ordered 3:1) Salted Caramel: my absolute favorite of the 3 2) Earl Grey: very subtle flavor of tea3) Pistachio: couldn't really taste any flavor, but that could be attributed to the mere fact that I practically inhaled the other 2 macarons with no time to give my palette a break.   The crisp yet moist texture of the outer shells along with the subtle flavor of the creamy filling was enough to make me wonder what the hell I was thinking in associating this lovely dessert with those icky store-bought, creme filled rectangular wafers I'm just glad that I've now been schooled in what a macaron is, so much so that I'm jumping on the bandwagon and ranting and raving all about them :)","Santa Monica, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,8/21/2012,0,4,

It looks as beautiful and as fresh as the day it opened but the service and food are more polished than ever. Loved the new artichoke pizza, loved the ceppo gambert and loooved the souffle. The macarons tasted better than ever and I love and appreciate the care they put into their beautiful desserts and keepsake packaging, truly world class.  Yes I love Louie and won't stay away as long just hate driving downtown.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Nick S.,"i average this place once a week at the very least. If there were room for 6 stars this would be the first place that I would review. Service: pretty sure there are 3 servers for every table in this joint. I have never seen so many waiters/bartenders/workers at the same time in one restaurant. There will be a wait if you come during prime time eating hours, but towards the end of the night (kitchen closes at 11pm) its a breeze getting a table at the bar and/or restaurant.  Food: pizza is to die for (mushroom is a must try). carmel salted cupcakes actually make me want to eat a cupcake - and I am not a cupcake eater, I'll take a man's cake thanks. pasta is ok, bottega salad is so good as well as blue cheese wedge.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Helen S.,"The first time I came here was when it just opened and it was just crazy, but my experiences have always gotten better and better.  Yes, there were the occasional mishaps but the management and servers have always been more than accommodating to make sure your overall dining experience was a pleasant one.  Occasionally I'll come here for dinner, but I love coming here for brunch!  I always get the eggs benedict and always devour it.  The bellinis and bloody mary is delicious and I usually don't like bloody marys.  The portobello mushrooms are AMAZING and I still order that every time I go.  It is extremely busy but oftentimes the hostess will just squeeze you in!  Oh, by the way, you MUST get the macarons from here.  Seriously, you must!  I think my favorite is the rose but try every single flavor!","Rancho Palos Verdes, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/XQWWkdYQ7zP2Ek-JcKBUIQ/60s.jpg,11/22/2011,239,415,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Carmen P.,"This place is so great it inspired me to stop just looking at yelp and actually post to yelp! The food? Great. The service? Great. The deserts? Great. The drinks? Great. Sure Great is a Great work but let me elaborate...Food: yum. the pizzas are huge and baked right as you order them the old fashion way - in a wood fire stove. The salad is beyond amazing (louie salad and blue cheese wedge salad are, for a lack of a better word, Great!)Drinks: I'm a tequila girl and that tequila drink of theirs is oh so Great! You can even order bottles of wine from their to-go section for a not to-go meal. Service: Our waiter danced for us. no joke. Have you ever had a waiter dance for you at any other restaurant? yea, didn't think so!As for parking and the wait I not going to call them cons, just giving a couple tips. Park in the open lot next door, it's like $5. Come prepared to wait and put you name on the list then go next door to mas malo and have a margarita and come back. They will never kick you out of line even if you miss your name being called because you were too busy drinks margs next door!THIS PLACE IS GREAT!","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TJUzvEzlW5ABMBapq9IrvQ/60s.jpg,10/19/2011,0,3,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Stan D.,"ah-may-zing. be prepared for a wait (at practically all times of every day) but once you get a table its your cue to order absolutely everything. The atmosphere is loud but fun and I have never seen more waiters at any other restaurant in LA - I swear there are at most 2 table to every waiter / bartender / manager running around and this place is pretty huge. 1. Order the portobello fries - you shouldn't even be allowed to come back if you don't order these your first time around. 2. Finish off your meal with a salted carmel cupcake - again if you fail to order this I don't even think you should be allowed to yelp about this place. Must try this cupcake because its the god send of all cupcakes. Good for boozy brunch, lunch, dinner, late night, cocktails, small bites, everything except dancing pretty much. I challenge someone (anyone!) to find a better restaurant in downtown LA then Louie's...","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TwjuJ9yNzhR9JM0Yi3szBw/60s.jpg,9/23/2011,8,10,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Grant P.,I LOVE this place!  I had a family mini reunion brunch and everyone loved it.  The place is beautiful and the food was as always awesome.  My favorite is the smoke salmon benedict and the burrata pizza.  The only negatives are they don't take reservations and will not seat you until the whole party is present and it gets a bit noisy.  I still give it a 5 star because the food and service is spectacular!,"Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/i98h8M3oWrXTvA8Th8w1hQ/60s.jpg,9/10/2011,1,2,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Stephanie D.,"Love this place,My man and I stopped by for a late lunch on Monday of President's day weekend, and the wait was only 10 minutes. We parked on the street (free after 3pm), half a block away.Decor: I really liked the open space, especially the open kitchen, and the place's modern and minimalistic decor. The dessert  setup was absolutely gorgeous. I could not stop drooling when I was deciding which flavor macaron I was gonna try first. (5 stars)Ambience: The only thing I didn't like was the noise level..it was quite loud. I think this would be a good place to take a first date, because it's nice but not super fancy. The loudness would definitely help out with the expected awkward moments. (4 stars)Service: We loved our server! He was pleasant, friendly, and helpful. He came back often to refill our waters, and would even crack some jokes.  (4.5 stars)Food: Yummy! We shared everything. We got a pizza, half sausage for the bf, and half clams for me (4 stars). For the pasta, we chose the Parpadelle (mushroom and foie gras)..it was simple, delicious, but could have used a bit more seasoning (4 stars). Of course, we had to try the portobello fries (4 stars +1 star for the dip)! It was light and crispy, and that aioli was divine. We had more than half a pizza leftover, but of course we had to try the macarons ($1.75/ea)! Earl Grey for me, and Espresso for him..both were good, but mine was way better. Pricey, but it melts in your mouth..and is so good it'll make you wanna slap your mama! Next time, I'm gonna try the rest of the flavors, and have a cupcake, too (comes with a baby macaron on top, so cutes)!It's a little pricey but all the good things in this life are ))","San Francisco, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/w2EwrI0IH8bmMw2gVJZ45Q/60s.jpg,5/9/2011,26,24,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Theresa P.,"I've been here about 5 times now, and I've never been disappointed.  This last time was particularly incredible because the waiter remembered us. Not just that he'd seen us before, either-- also, that we'd sat over there, and that we ordered everything family style.  Seriously. He sees thousands of people a week-- how is this possible? As for the food, the wait, the space--everyone has already said most of what you need to know, but just to add my own 2 cents:This is not the place to order things that show up on every menu in town (calamari, for example).  It will be fine, but not mind-blowing and you'll find your self wondering why you waited an hour for a table.  Bottega Louie excels at simple, elegant dishes that are creative without being fussy. Here's what I usually order (to share, of course):Pizza BiancoPortabello FriesCorn w/ Bacon & Chard (Ah-mazing!)Arrancini (fried rissotto)Beets w/ goat cheeseBudino (for dessert)The best strategy is to order a pizza or an entree, and a handful of small plates.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Irving C.,"In for the weekend from Vegas cant get over the transformation of Downtown Los Angeles (WOW), it feels like NYC and Bottega Louie is what's making it better. The design is amazing, the service is tight, the pizza is top notch and the desserts esp. the macarons are even better.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Carlos K.,"I just ate there for there first time after reading all the reviews.  I did'nt know what to expect and was very pleased.  It is a beatiful space and has just a great energy in it.  It is not your typical LA restaurant (thank god).  I had the margherita pizza, ceaser salad, and a pilsner urquell.  Being from NYC I thought the pizza was dead on and worth every dollar.  It tasted fresh and was quick to the table.  I wish they sold slices!  The ceaser was the classic ceaser and I have no complaints.  I liked the fact that it was not diced up ceaser but with the large lettuce leafs.  Compliments to them for having Pilsner Urquell on tap as well!  Most of my favorite NY pizzerias had it.  On my way out I bought some fried chicken and some meatloaf in their market to try at home.  I now know I can no longer buy my dinner at Ralphs or Whole Foods.  Both items were delicious, large sized, and very decently priced.  In fact, I plan to do a lot of shopping in their market.  I also had 2 oatmeal cookies and they were by far the best cookies I can remember having.  Seriously - try them.  I would like to point out something of interest that no one talked about.  Although the space is huge and this can lead it to be somewhat loud, I liked this energy.  What I noticed was that in the bar area they were playing some very cool music - I even heard some hip hop mixed in among the rock, punk, and classics.  I think it shows that Bottega Louie is something different in that they are not just playing Sinatra like any other Italian restaurant.  It really added to the vibe and I think would be a great happy hour hang out spot.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,9/10/2009,0,2,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Jasmine M.,"I love this place.  New York style, for sure.  Even though it looks like a high end restaurant, everything is affordable, the servers are on top of their menus, the hosts make you feel welcome, and everything about it is just magnificent.  This is definitely the newest hot spot in downtown Los Angeles!","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,9/9/2009,5,8,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Susanne H.,"This place makes me want to visit downtown LA. It is something that I would expect to find in Manhattan or San Francisco. It has lots of energy with it's extra high ceilings and marble floors. All the voices echo in this wonderful establishment.Their desserts all look wonderful. However, the crust of their tarts are too hard for me. Napoleans are good.The side dishes are incredibly varied and all look very appealing. They make Brussels spouts look good. Or was I just that hungay?!","Cypress, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,9/9/2009,0,5,
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Scott A.,"Bottega Louie is more than a restaurant ... it's an experience.To start, visually it's a jewel ... when you pass it on the street at night,you instantly feel like it's an expensive restaurant and that you need to go home and change into something more upscale.  But once inside, after you peek at the menu, you're suprised to find that the prices are very reasonable, and the dress is casual.The staff is amazing!  They go out of their way to take the experience from fine dining to an experience!As for the food ... you have to try:The Portobello Mushroom FriesThe Lasagne (one serving is large enough to serve 4)& The Sausage Pizza!All of their food is terrific, order to share, and if you need more, thePizza's take 7 minutes!Since I moved downtown 4 months ago, I've dined there at least 6 times.  They quickly recognize the locals, and even though there are no reservations, ask about their Corporate Concierge program, and they will go out of their way to accomodate you.Employees that stand out:Eric & Nicole!Whenever I have guests that come to visit, it's off to Bottega Louie!Can't wait till they deliver.Oh yeah, and I went with a party of 8 one night for a birthday dinner.We ordered lots of appetizers, food and wine ... and it was $35/ea!Very reasonable!!","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/mQceCLPUqJ8qaVsNIgiqXw/60s.jpg,8/5/2009,4,6,4
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Pauline T.,"You know how kids get all crazy excited when they're inside a ginormous candy store? Well, imagine that crazy excited kid as me, entering this grand, white NY-style food palace and grubbing and OoooHing and ahhhh-ing at all the scrumptious desserts, pizza, fresh bread, deli-fixins' and appreciating the classy-modern white decor, pristine marble floors, high lofted ceilings, ornate French custom molding, open airy ambiance, and the whole nine yards at my fave LA dining spot, Bottega Louie.Upon my first visit, my friends and I were literally drooling over the desserts and deli items, and I guess it was pretty obvious, so one of the 220 uber friendly staff members voluntarily gave us a helpful little tour of each area. We learned that Bottega Louie is not just any type of fine dining restaurant. It is ALL of the below and then some. a) It's a bakery/dessert shop that includes but is not limited to the following items: cute mini cupcakes, sweet chocolate squares branded with the restaurant's initials BL, crispy sweet pastries and muffins, gooey fresh fruit tarts and pies, fresh baked french bread and even chocolate bread, skinny mini baguettes, and macaroons that come in all sorts of colors of the rainbow. If you order enough pastries and dessert to fill a box, you'll leave home with a pretty in pink box tied with a bow.b) It has a visible pizza making station! Yup, a really cool pizza making station is located in the back of the restaurant with clean white brick walls and a glass wall that allows you to see the wood-fired pizza getting tossed and then freshly baked in the oven. c) It's a fresh deli that serves the BEST eggplant parmigiana! I had to hold myself back from ordering too much at the deli, but I had my eye on the fried chicken, mac n' cheese, and quiche lorraine. They are so clever with the packaging of their deli items because they give you this white, pristine envelope and card that gives you instructions on how long to cook your leftover food in the microwave and/or oven. It really adds a very classy touch to your carry out items and it makes for a memorable souvenir if you're into pretty stationary cards and arts and crafts stuff like I am. d) It's a fully-stocked bar/cafe that is frequented by various people from downtown loft dwellers and yuppies to hipsters and after-work patrons. So far I only tried their red wine and it complemented well with my dinner. My friend can attest that the bar service was great and one of the bartenders was ultimate eye candy for her while she waited for us laggers to arrive.e) Last, but certainly not least, it's a fine dining establishment that deserves 5 stars for its food! I am still drooling over the crispy portobello fries dipped in their special aioli sauce. That has been my staple appetizer at every single visit. My usual entree is the grilled pork chops (one order comes with 3!) with a side of apple sauce for dipping. I know it sounds strange, but there's a nice balance between the salty and sweet flavors. Many of their dishes are perfect for sharing family style, so if there are 3 of you, get the 3 succulent, grilled pork chops!  If you want something buttery and savory, the trenne is definitely the way to go. It's an amazing pasta that tastes light, but is super buttery and is tossed with tiny chunks of beef and some greens. Other notable dishes:  fresh bianco (basil) pizza and arrianchi arrabiata appetizer (think fried mozzarella sticks but in the form of balls and stuffed with rice and cheese).  Save room for dessert because you won't want to miss out on the delicious warm chocolate soufflé! If you have more room for dessert, try the sweet simi freddo and light orange crepe. Not only is Bottega Louie impeccable and unique in terms of food, ambiance, and decor, but its service is among the best I've ever had in downtown. The highlight of our service was gettin that initial tour by that friendly staff member. I wonder if she gives consistent tours to other people, but I'd like to think we were the special trio that lucked out that one evening. That was a great precedent to what was to follow for our perfect dining experience. Our waitress  was hospitable and knowledgeable about each dish and was pretty attentive in clearing our dishes along with other random staff members who were always quick to clean our table and fill up our water. After we ate dessert, this handome guy who looked like a manager in a three-piece suit just happened to roll by and happily took our picture. He was a mix between Adam Levine and David Beckham, so, yes, they are friendly AND good looking! Bottega Louie truly is a diamond in a rough, as it is located on the dingy streets of 7th and Grand. There's no other place in LA that can give you that same look and feel as if you're dining in NY but with reasonable prices, great hospitality, and superb ambiance and decor.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/aPaknG6tSVQZlGuKTJqmyg/60s.jpg,7/21/2009,59,41,11
Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,chelsea g.,"I am on business from NYC  staying at the standard for 3 weeks and have never reviewed a place before but I must say I was blown away. I am so proud of who ever created and executed this marvelous place.. I wish it would transplant itself to NYC.. this place is perfect from the architecture with the majestic high ceiling to the marble and brass perfect. The service is top notch and great to look at particularly the lovely hostesses.  The coffee bar area where I have spend two solid afternoons on wi fi enjoying latte's and an array of amazing pastries is great, reminded me of a cafe in Paris. Around 4 this place is perfect for a true mixology concoction,the dirty martini hits the spot.  Had dinner there with a large group 2 nights in a row, service professional and attentive. The vibe was happy and festive. The food solid, loved pizza bianco and pizza margherita on par to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and that says a whole lot. The pasta fresca was fresh and delicious, had a bunch of small plates all very good. Trenne pasta was a particular strand out dish. I seriously enjoyed my time at this very cool restaurant that can compete and beat any establishment in NYC. Los Angeles just got better I will be back.","New York, NY",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,5/22/2009,0,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Ashley J.,"After I had been in the restaurant a few times I found out that Bottega Louie caters lunches to offices in Downtown.  I called in to place an order and was surprised to find out that they choose the food for you when you have lunch catered.  I was a little nervous, but they asked me lots of questions like when would we be eating, how many people, and any special dietary needs.  They told me that they'd customize the order because they know what would be new that day and what would travel best.  My group and I were very pleased with their selection.  They delivered it to our office on time, set it up beautifully, and the food was delicious!  Some of the items they chose were Italian Salad, Rigatoni Fresca, and Chicken Milanese.Eating in Bottega's beautiful space is wonderful, but having their food catered for lunch is really nice as well!","San Jose, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,5/13/2009,0,2,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Iris S.,"I just moved in to DTLA in this last month and had heard a lot about this place from a lot of my neighbors so I decided to give it a try. I took my mom for mothers day brunch and it was AWESOME!!! The place is very elegant and gives you a feel of classic big city dinning from an era when people actually dressed up to go into the city. Marble floors, high ceiling and brass trim on everything. The staff are all super attentive and really attractive. We came in just the two of us and had a really short wait time which we enjoined at the bar sipping on mimosas. They also have a great market with really yummy looking pasteries, sandwhiches, etc. We ordered the bianco pizza with pepperoni and it was soooo goood! we also tried the burrata and grape tomatoes which was as good as the pizze. My mom had the lentil soup as an appetizers which she loved. The waiters are really  great at describing the food and recommending there favs their service is excellent. the food was great and the vibe in the room was really mellow and fun. Needless to say my mom had a great time and she felt really special. I will definitly be coming back soon.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,5/10/2009,0,1,

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,Smokey D.,"Just got back from Budapest and had a layover in LA for a few days so decided to check out Bottega Louie. Was I glad I did. I arrived about 7 PM Saturday night without any reservations and was seated within 15 minutes. (Have waited for several hours at some upscale Paris restaurants whose food I can say didn't compare with the extraordinary fare at Bottega Louie) The decor is enchanting and really adds to the culinary experience that awaits you. I started off with the lentil soup, which was fantastic. Just the right touch of seasoning which made the broth light and savory. I had the lasagna for my main course, which I would say was the best I've had. I can still imagine the taste several days later and now can't wait for my next layover in LA to get it again. Had a small sausage pizza, with the wonderful thin crust, cooked to perfection, and just the right portions of sauce to cheese. The service was excellent and the waiters were always easily accessible when you needed something. The whole restaurant experience was one of the best I have had, even better then some of the Michelin 3 star restaurants I have eaten at. I was so impressed that I had to stop back on the way to the airport to stock up on some of the great products in the market and get some coffee and pastries for the plane ride home. I can't wait till my next layover in LA to experience all the other mouth watering delicacies on the menu and do some more shopping, since what I bought only lasted a couple days at home.","Las Vegas, NV",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/FcZiI2p40hXntw7kd-BRBg/60s.jpg,5/8/2009,0,1,

I wish I could have tried everything on the menu, but here's a few things that left me in awe. The Louie salad is of the highest quality I've ever seen and the taste, incredible!  Napoli pizza is better than the one I had in Napoli, my husbands pork chop with peas & prosciutto side was magnificent. The desserts make you saliva just to look at, and the taste is unforgettable.

Los Angeles,Bottega Louie,colby c.,"New york transplant.. I had dinner at Bottega Louie last night and must say that  we had an elegant, yummy dinner from start to finish.   Our Pizza Bianco was amazing, thin crust and perfect. The trenne and bronzino as good as some really top restaurant s in NYC for half the price. The peanut butter dessert is dangerously good.  The service a bit too attentive but I would rather be overserved than my needs ignored.  I think it's sad that there are haters or competitors writing negative reviews, this place is a blessing to the downtown location and a welcome beautiful addition.  Im just glad I now have an affordable, delicious option close to home. Did I mention the amazing gourmet market and pastries to go.","Los Angeles, CA",5.0,https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/yelp_styleguide/514f6997a318/assets/img/default_avatars/user_60_square.png,4/11/2009,0,1,
